# Cybrary Technical Interview
The purpose of this is to evaluate an intervieweeâ€™s technical knowledge and understanding in a day-to-day like scenario.

During this interview, the interviewee is given a group of articles in a JSON format. The interviewee must display all articles in a digestible format on page 1 and display each article in an easily readable format on page 2. The interviewee must also create a liking system for articles so the reader is able to express a positive reaction towards the article. Be sure to follow the requirements listed below.

This interview is completely open book. During a work day you'll have access to anything on the internet so why not during the interview? Yes, that includes stackoverflow.
