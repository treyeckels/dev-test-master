        "post_teaser": "The CEH exam carries a lot of hype, as people are determined to become ethical hackers and want a signifier of their skills. While the CEH is ideal for that, you will want to have prior security knowledge before jumping right into the exam. If you have some security knowledge already and need a way to gauge your skills before the exam, a CEH practice exam can help you in deciding if this is the right exam for you to pursue at the moment.I passed my test earlier this morning. I'm a front-end web developer. I've been doing work as a Govt. contractor for about 7 or 8 years now. I don't have much security background aside from getting my Security+ cert in 2013 for no real reason other than it interested me and would my resume. I took the latest version of Sec+ earlier this year to renew it, and I started my CEH journey because an upcoming contract requires Sec+ and CEH to meet DOD 8570 certification requirements.I spent about 3 months preparing at a slower pace, but you could easily do it quicker than that. A lot\u00a0of the CEH body of knowledge is stuff you'll see with Security+ and other basic certs. It's definitely a good idea to have some sort of foundation, whether through certs or job experience. For example, does ethical hacking use bollards? Not technically. Will you still see questions about stuff like that? Yes.I finished the whole thing in about 90 minutes, with 60 to answer all the questions, and 30 to review all my answers, plus the few flagged questions. Overall, I'd say this exam is easier than the latest version of Security+. You could essentially call it Security+ with some questions about specific tools + output, and vulnerabilities, IMO.I know the exam can sound intimidating, and it tends to get played up and made larger than it is, but you shouldn't be scared. I recommend browsing Kali's tool list and knowing a lot of those at the basic level. Aside from tools and attack types, you should know your general security principles like defense-in-depth, getting permission before hacking, etc.Brendan Zhu, Web DeveloperBrendan offers a good overview of what content knowledge is needed to prepare for the test. Perhaps his best piece of advice is not to hype the exam up to bigger than it is, or let fear overwhelm you from being successful.

        "post_teaser": "There\u2019s been a lot of chatter surrounding the CCNA exam. More specifically, which test format is best to guarantee you\u2019ll pass. While that answer is entirely dependent on the individual, the CCNA Practice Test can be a valuable resource in helping you to evaluate where your knowledge lies and choosing the format that coincides best.So today I passed the 200-125 (the composite\u00a0CCNA exam). I was a little too nervous at the start of the exam.To give some background, I'm just over 3 years (and 3 jobs) into my professional IT career, and this will be the first IT certification I hold. My third job (a Fortune 100 company that I guarantee everybody has heard of) placed a very heavy emphasis on obtaining my CCNA.At the start I felt (Oh, it's not as easy as I thought). Then there was that section with simulations where you answer a few questions. It first gives you instructions on how to use it then you're supposed to click on the questions tab and so... I clicked on NEXT thinking it would bring up the questions, but what happened was it took empty answers for all of them and went to the next section and you cannot go back. At this point I felt really really really frustrated! I lost all those points without even going through the questions.Then I told myself \"It's a silly little easy exam! I don't need those missed points anyway.\u201d Went ahead, finished the remaining questions and had about 10 minutes left I think at the end. I got 830 and the pass was 810. Not sure how many questions accounted for those 20 points.It's all about knowing the basics really. For example, you need to know two routers interfaces must be setup in the same area to establish OSPF.Mostly I liked the simulations where you need to run show commands for troubleshooting! That part was awesome! It was so fluid tapping into the routers and navigating and running those lovely show commands. I found it easier to use than even packet tracer!All in all, I think the advice about taking the exams separately still holds true if you're brand new to networking. As I said before, I have three years of professional experience to work with; not all of that was networking-based, but coming into my studies, I already knew what a MAC address and IP address was, the basics of subnetting, the roles of a router and switch, and so on. If you're thinking about pursuing a CCNA and have similar experience, then the composite exam will provide a decent challenge; otherwise, I would advise you stick with the separate exams.John Driscoll, Network AdministratorLessons learned from John\u2019s experience include determining which testing format is right for you; taking the exam in two parts or as one comprehensive tests. Practice tests can help determine which will be best.Similarly, you\u2019ll experience what it\u2019s like to go through the testing questions before it really counts so nuances such as a \u2018next\u2019 button won\u2019t hinder you on the real exam. Chances are, when taking the exam for the first time, you\u2019ll fluctuate between whether or not you think the exam is easy. Stay confident and trust in your preparation. After all, no one knows how you study best except you. Use every tool at your disposal.With the A+ practice test, you gain 6-month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the exam, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0 This Practice Test has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs.

After all, no one knows how you study best except you. Use every tool at your disposal.\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Practice Test?</strong></h3>\r\nWith the A+ practice test, you gain 6-month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the exam, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0 This Practice Test has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs. Select items by test objective, set study preferences and control how your answers are accessed.</li>\r\n \t<li>Select preset tests. These tests are made to provide a testing experience similar to a real testing environment. They are timed and filter questions like the certification exam. This option will help you determine your readiness for the certification exam.</li>\r\n \t<li>Flashcard review allows you to review concepts in a self-graded and unlimited environment. With hundreds of questions, these premade flashcards will help you understand concepts covered on the actual certification exam.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><strong>How Will it Help Me Pass?</strong></h3>\r\nIf used correctly, the practice test will help you pass because it will ultimately give you a simulated exam in the same format with the same timing as a real exam. Often, we\u2019re not used to taking an exam in this manner, so it helps us feel comfortable that the material, not the environment, is the focus. It all goes back to confidence.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you get feedback specific to topic areas that need improvement so you can spend time reviewing what you don\u2019t know rather than wasting time going over all the content.\r\n\r\nWe recommend first going through the exam in assessment mode (option 2, as listed above) to see what you know and don\u2019t know going into the exam. Then, use options 1 and 3 to hone in on specific topics that need improvement. Lastly, go through option 2 as many times as needed until you feel comfortable going into the real test.\r\n<h3><strong>Transcender A+ Practice Test Reviews</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>I use TranscenderCert exam simulations exclusively as a result of repeated success on Cisco certification exams.

This is the latest of the Vault 7 leaks, released June 15th.\u00a0Someone with a green thumb must have named 'Cherry Blossom,' \u00a0a framework being used by the CIA for monitoring the Internet activity of the targeted systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi devices. Apparently developed alongside\u00a0the Stanford Research Institute (SRI International), an American nonprofit research institute,\u00a0as part of its \u2018Cherry Bomb\u2019 project, 'Cherry Blossom' is a remotely controllable firmware-based implant for wireless networking devices, including routers and wireless access points (APs). Using 'Cherry Blossom, you can\u00a0exploit router vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and then replace firmware with custom 'Cherry Blossom' firmware. Once the firmware is in place, an implanted device, 'Flytrap,'\u00a0can then be used to monitor the internet activity of and deliver software exploits to targets of interest.According to Wikileaks, \"CIA hackers use Cherry Blossom hacking tool to hijack wireless networking devices on the targeted networks and then perform man-in-the-middle attacks to monitor and manipulate the Internet traffic of connected users.\" After you've gained control of\u00a0the wireless device, 'Cherry Blossom' reports back to CIA controlled command-and-control server referred as 'Cherry Tree,' where it receives instructions and performs malicious tasks including: monitoring network traffic to collect email addresses, chat user names, MAC addresses, and VoIP numbers, redirecting connected users to malicious websites, setting up VPN tunnels to access clients connected to Flytrap's WLAN/LAN for further exploitation, and copying of the full network traffic of a targeted device. \u00a0In a list from the Hacker News, they state: \"'Cherry Blossom' has the ability to exploit vulnerabilities in hundreds of Wi-Fi devices manufactured by the following vendors: Belkin, D-Link, Linksys, Aironet/Cisco, Apple AirPort Express, Allied Telesyn, Ambit, AMIT Inc, Accton, 3Com, Asustek Co, Breezecom, Cameo, Epigram, Gemtek, Global Sun, Hsing Tech, Orinoco, PLANET Technology, RPT Int, Senao, US Robotics and Z-Com.\"The wireless device itself is compromised by implanting a customized CherryBlossom firmware on it; some devices allow upgrading their firmware over a wireless link, so no physical access to the device is necessary for a successful infection. -WikileaksFor a full perspective on all sides of the Wikileaks debate read, 'Wikileaks: The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly!'\u00a0According to a recent report from the FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there is a new warning about an ongoing, eight-year-long North Korean state-sponsored hacking operation 'Hidden Cobra 'by the malicious hacking group, the Lazarus Group.\u00a0The group is strongly suspected to have a malware variant 'DeltaCharlie' which could infect hundreds of thousands of computers globally as part of its DDoS botnet network as part of 'Hidden Cobra', the report warns. And that's not the worse part, 'Lazarus Group' also known as 'Guardians of Peace,' is believed to be backed by the North Korean government and are known to launch cyber attacks against global institutions, including media organizations, aerospace and financial sectors, and critical infrastructure. They have previously been involved with the 2013 DarkSeoul operation, the devastating 2014 Sony Pictures Hack, and may have been involved in WannaCry.In the new report, the agencies\u00a0identified IP addresses with \"high confidence\" associated with 'DeltaCharlie,' which can\u00a0launch a variety of DDoS attacks on its targets, including Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, Network Time Protocol (NTP) attacks, and Character Generation Protocol (CGP) attacks. \"The botnet malware is capable of downloading executables on the infected systems, updating its own binaries, changing its own configuration in real-time, terminating its processes, and activating and terminating DDoS attacks.\" Somewhat surprisingly, it is not new. 'DeltaCharlie' was initially reported by Novetta in their 2016 Operation Blockbuster Malware Report. However,\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky Lab, recently detected one 'Hidden Cobra' malware sample contained a hard-coded IP that belongs to a major U.S. financial institution.The DHS and FBI recommend that network administrators review the IP addresses, file hashes, network signatures, and YARA rules provided, and add the IPs to their watchlist to determine if the malicious activity has occurred on their network.If users or administrators detect the custom tools indicative of HIDDEN COBRA, these tools should be immediately flagged, reported to the DHS National Cybersecurity Communications and Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and given highest priority for enhanced mitigation. -official alert statementTo learn more about the Lazarus Group, read this previous issue of UNM4SK3D.\u00a0Security researchers have discovered the culprit behind cyber attacks on the Ukrainian industrial control systems in December 2015, and this discovery has other countries worried over what could happen if the malware puts 'lights out' again.\u00a0The power outage in the northern part of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, leading to a blackout for tens of thousands of citizens is believed to be caused by\u00a0a dangerous piece of malware in the wild that targets critical industrial control systems. Discovered by\u00a0Slovakia-based security software maker ESET and US critical infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc., this malware, dubbed 'Industroyer' or 'CrashOverRide,'\u00a0is the biggest threat designed to disrupt industrial control systems since Stuxnet. You may remember Stuxnet as \"the first malware allegedly developed by the US and Israel to sabotage the Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009.\" Unlike Stuxnet, 'CrashOverRide' relies\u00a0on four industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems.'CrashOverRide' can control electricity substation switches and circuit breakers, allowing an attacker to simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and causing more severe damage to equipment, partially because these systems were designed so long ago. In the opinion of Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee, \"the 'CrashOverRide' malware is capable of causing power outages that can last up to a few days in portions of a country's electric grid, but it is not capable enough to bring down the entire grid of a nation.\" Further,\u00a0\"'CrashOverRide' is not unique to any particular vendor or configuration and instead leverages knowledge of grid operations and network communications to cause impact; in that way, it can be immediately re-purposed in Europe and portions of the Middle East and Asia.\" Likewise,\u00a0the malware can be modified to target other types of critical infrastructure, like transportation, gas lines, or water facilities, as well with additional protocol modules.The malware contains a few more features that are designed to enable it to remain under the radar, to ensure the malware's persistence, and to wipe all traces of itself after it has done its job. -ESET researchersDespite the danger of this new malware, there are still best practices.

Many may not have been keen to embrace Android due to security concerns, But with the potential to lower business expenses and a recent increase in Security measures that myth has been dispelled. So, with Google pushing Android for Work quite heavily, I will try breakdown what you should know and help you get started.I will quickly explain some of the things you may need to know if your company has decided to look into using Android for Business or if this is something you want to look into these are some of the things you will need to know.BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) BYOD has been around for a while now but while it can save the company from having to buy handsets for its users and it can cut costs it also opens up a whole new world of Security issues that need to be resolved but with someBusiness Data Business data is secure by creating a business profile on the device ensuring only that profile can access business data and data leakage policies can be enforced on the device.Device SecuritySecurity Standards are maintained by blocking Apps from unknown sources being installed on devices and by enforcing a minimum version of Android (e.g.) V4.0.1 Operating System on any\u00a0Android build standards can be enforced by ensuring the device has specific software installed or settings configured such as\u2026\u2026\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whole Disk Encryption (WDE)\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lock-screen\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anti-Virus\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Remote Attestation (Ensuring no changes are made to the device)There are also other apps you can have installed on the devices to ensure that ensure unapproved applications cannot run by creating a whitelist.\u00a0If your company is sold on those points, then the first thing you need to do is get an Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) provider. This can be Google directly or a third party provider. These companies can help deliver a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Solution.Hopefully, this information helps you grasp the concepts behind what needs to be done in order to use an Android smartphone in a business capacity and maximize security to try and mitigate any potential risks to the business.",

Your boss has given you a USB flash drive which was recovered from a suspect's home. He is suspected to be a fraud who is involved in credit card scams.Inside the USB is the following files (which you must set-up):Let's download an image and rename it: BlvckAr7.jpg.This is a basic image, within this we'll place a secret file i.e. use stenography, which we'll come to a little later.[caption id=\"attachment_94456\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"281\"] Right click image, then select \"save as\" or \"save image as\" to save this file to your computer.[/caption]\u00a0A zip file, which appears to be password protected... We'll come to this later.~$ The_setup_1Kali Linux OS (on any environment)If you do not have a Kali box, there are plenty of tutorials out there which go through, a step-by-step process in order to install and configure it properly. NOTE, it would be worthless installing and configuring a Kali machine SPECIFICALLY for this article. However, I would suggest it if you're interested in hacking and forensics in general. I'll leave links towards the end of this article for tutorials and guides on the installation process.A USB flash drive\u00a0(to set the scene, this isn't a necessity though)Assuming you have these two requirements, let's move on to the next stage.~$ The_setup_2sudo apt-get upgrade (if your machine requires upgrading)sudo apt-get install steghideNow that we have the tool required, let's create our secret file.You can use any text editor. Name this file S3CR37Z.txt, and the layout should look something like this:FORENAME SURNAME: \u00a0 \u00a0ACCOUNT NUMBERTYPE: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0VISAEXPIRATION: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 DATECreate multiple entries, and try to make it seem as real as possible.Once you've completed this task, let's hide this file into the image file we downloaded earlier. In order to do this, we use steghide. On the terminal enter the following:steghide embed -cf BlvckAr7.jpg -ef S3CR37Z.txtNext, it will ask you for a password. For this, we will use qwerty123 (Of course this is significantly insecure, however, the criminal assumes nobody would know that the file is hidden inside of the image).Once we have completed this successfully we can delete S3CR37Z.txtType in rm S3CR37Z.txt (to remove the text file with the secret contents).Subsequently we create a zip file which is named cats.zip. This zip will also be password protected and contain the image BlvckAr7.jpgzip -e cats.zip BlvckAr7.jpgAgain, it will ask you for a password, which we will set as scarface23 (this password is more secure than the last, however is it really strong?)--- At this point you should have a zip file named cats.zip, inside of this zip, is an image, within the image is a secret file, which we have no access to ---If you've reached this point, great! Now it's time to store this zipfile into a USB, which is the hypothetical USB we've recovered from the crime scene. So place the content inside of it and let's begin with the forensics!~$ Setting_the_scene \u00a0--Forensic_AnalystOkay so, we receive a USB stick, the first thing we should do as a forensic analyst is to create a bit-by-bit image of it, and verify the integrity of it, however before we proceed with this, we should create a folder called 'Secure_Store'.Within this, we will have a few more folders.mkdir Secure_Storecd Secure_Store; mkdir image logical physical analysisFor this assignment we will be using image, physical and analysis.Image will contain the bit-by-bit copied imagephysical will contain the contents of the USBand analysis will have our analysis of the USB, i.e. our findings.Once we have created these directories we must unmount the flash drive from the main file system, so that we could image it, and mount it within our Secure evidence directory (Secure_Store)We do this by entering:df -hl (this will list the drives withing your machine)You should look for the flash drive, if you're finding difficulties in doing so, you could unplug it, run the same command and find the differences between the result.Filesystem \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 size \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 used \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 avail \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 use% \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 mounted onThe above should be the columns that the command returns, once we have identified the USB drive, locate where it is mounted.From this we should note the filesystem entry of the USB and the mounted on entry.It may look something like: /media/root/Name_of_USB in the mount entry column. (This would differ depending on your user name, USB name etc.)So we can copy that row (/media/root/Name_of_USB)Next, type in the following command to remove it from the main filesystem:umount\u00a0/media/root/Name_of_USBnow type the df command again to see if it has been removed from the list.Next we create a bit-by-bit image by using the name of the USB filesystem. We could use dd, or dd_secure, either one would be an excellent choice. This may take a while, so be patient.dd if=/dev/sdb1 \u00a0 of=~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.ddWhere it says /dev/sdb1 on this example, you may need to change it depending on the results from the output of your df -lh command.***NOTE BE VERY CAUTIOUS***Once this task is complete, we can verify the bit-by-bit copy by using the md5 hashing algorithm.md5sum /dev/sdb1mdf5sum ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.ddif these provide the exact same result, we're good to go!It may be best to note these down, or store them in a text file, for the final report (We won't be going over the report as part of this article)Subsequently we can mount the USB inside of the Secure_Store/physical directorymount ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.dd ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/physicalNow if we go into the physical directory we should see a zip file named cats.zip... copy it to the analysis directory, begin working inside of the analysis\u00a0directory. Now we can see, it has a password? How do we get around this?Let's create a small password cracking script with python. The password file we will use is called rockyou.txt. This file could be found online, it contains millions of real-user passwords, which were found on vulnerable website databases.Go to this website, https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords, and click on rockyou.txt.bz2, give it some time to download.Once we have it downloaded, extract the file into your Desktop.Now let's make the script.This script will loop through every line within the rockyou.txt file, attempting to extract the files from the cats.zip folder passing the line as a password.Open a text editor, we'll just use gedit, enter gedit zipCracker.py################################################ \u00a0Created by Aslam Admani for Cybrary WannaCrack blog ################################################import zipfiledef Main()\u00a0 \u00a0 f = open('~/Desktop/rockyou.txt', 'r') #open the rockyou.txt file in read mode\u00a0 \u00a0 for line in f.readlines(): #iterate through each line of the password file\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0pw = line.strip('n') #remove default newline keys at the end of each password\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0try:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0zfile = zipfile.ZipFile('/root/Desktop/Secure_Store/physical/cats.zip') #declare the zip file you want to use, the path I'm using is /root/Desktop/ Because I'm using the root user, find the current working directory in which your zip file lies.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0zfile.extractall(/root/Desktop/Secure_Store/physical ,pwd=pw) #attempt to extract all from the zip file, with the current password\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0print 'password found: %s' % pw \u00a0#if this works, print the password to the screen\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 except:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0pass #otherwise pass until we have our passwordif __name__ == '__main__':\u00a0 \u00a0 Main()The python script looks good, run it in the terminal:python zipCracker.pyThis may take a while depending on how deep the passwords we made are within the rockyou.txt file.If this has run successfully, which it should, your next objective is to analyse the image we see...We have an image named BlvckAr7.jpg, it appears to look like a normal jpeg file. However the eyes can deceive, we must dig further.Let's start, using EXIFTOOL.Exiftool is an analysis tool, which can analyse many file extensions, find original extensions plus more.exiftool BlvckAr7.jpgif this command doesn't work, use sudo apt-get install exiftool to install it.With this jpg file we shouldn't see anything particularly suspicious?However let's put our forensics caps on and think outside the box, we have an image which states 'nothing to see here', let's google this and see if we have the same image, with the same extension, if so, we could download all similar files and compare the sizes. Maybe that could give us a lead?So we download the exact same images we find, and we compare the sizes, using exiftool, notice the difference? One is bigger than the other right?Let's check the integrity of both files, using md5sum,We can see there's a difference. Maybe it could be that this image was taken from another source, or something of the sort, regardless we have our suspicions. Let's assume there's another file inside of the S3CR37Z.jpg file, so let's now use steghide to extract what we may have in there.steghide extract -sf BlvckAr7.jpgit's asking us for a passphrase, what do we do here!Let's create a python file called StegCrack.py\u00a0###############################################\u00a0Created by Aslam Admani for Cybrary WannaCrack blog###############################################import pexpectimport osdef Main():\u00a0 \u00a0 PROMPT = ['$ ', \u00a0'# ', '> ', '>> ']\u00a0 \u00a0 f=open('~/Desktop/rockyou.txt', 'r')\u00a0 \u00a0 for line in f.readlines():\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 pw = line.strip('n')\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 try:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 child = pexpect.spawn('steghide extract -sf S3CR37Z.jpg')\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 child.expect([pexpect.TIMEOUT, 'passphrase: ', 'Passphrase: ', 'password: '])\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 child.sendline(pw)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0child.expect(PROMPT)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0except:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0passif __name__ == '__main__':\u00a0 \u00a0 Main()This should release the hidden file into the current directory, and now we should see a file called: S3CR37Z.txtUnfortunately this script doesn't display the password to the output, however you can check out my github to see if there are any updates to these scripts.\u00a0https://github.com/c0d14kIf you're interested or need help, here's a video to show how to download and install Kali Linux on VMWare Player: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5mNnkG0FVkCongratulations if you have completed this article, followed along and were sucessful!Comments and tips would be highly appreciated.",

This may take a while, so be patient.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>dd if=/dev/sdb1 \u00a0 of=~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.dd</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Where it says /dev/sdb1 on this example, you may need to change it depending on the results from the output of your df -lh command.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>***NOTE BE VERY CAUTIOUS***</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnce this task is complete, we can verify the bit-by-bit copy by using the md5 hashing algorithm.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>md5sum /dev/sdb1</strong></li>\r\n \t<li><strong>mdf5sum ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.dd</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>if these provide the exact same result, we're good to go!</li>\r\n \t<li>It may be best to note these down, or store them in a text file, for the final report (We won't be going over the report as part of this article)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSubsequently we can mount the USB inside of the Secure_Store/physical directory\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>mount ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.dd ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/physical</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow if we go into the physical directory we should see a zip file named cats.zip... <strong>copy it to the analysis directory, begin working inside of the analysis</strong>\u00a0<strong>directory</strong>. Now we can see, it has a password? How do we get around this?\r\n\r\nLet's create a small password cracking script with python. The password file we will use is called rockyou.txt. This file could be found online, it contains millions of real-user passwords, which were found on vulnerable website databases.\r\n\r\nGo to this website, <a href=\"https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords\">https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords</a>, and click on rockyou.txt.bz2, give it some time to download.\r\n\r\nOnce we have it downloaded, extract the file into your Desktop.\r\n\r\nNow let's make the script.\r\n\r\nThis script will loop through every line within the rockyou.txt file, attempting to extract the files from the cats.zip folder passing the line as a password.\r\n\r\nOpen a text editor, we'll just use gedit, enter <strong>gedit zipCracker.py</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>###############################################</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong># \u00a0Created by Aslam Admani for Cybrary WannaCrack blog #</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>###############################################</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>import zipfile</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>def Main()</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 f = open('~/Desktop/rockyou.txt', 'r') #open the rockyou.txt file in read mode</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 for line in f.readlines(): #iterate through each line of the password file</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0pw = line.strip('n') #remove default newline keys at the end of each password</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0try:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0zfile = zipfile.ZipFile('/root/Desktop/Secure_Store/physical/cats.zip') #declare the zip file you want to use, the path I'm using is /root/Desktop/ Because I'm using the root user, find the current working directory in which your zip file lies.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0zfile.extractall(/root/Desktop/Secure_Store/physical ,pwd=pw) #attempt to extract all from the zip file, with the current password</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0print 'password found: %s' % pw \u00a0#if this works, print the password to the screen</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 except:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0pass #otherwise pass until we have our password</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>if __name__ == '__main__':</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 Main()</strong>\r\n\r\nThe python script looks good, run it in the terminal:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>python zipCracker.py</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis may take a while depending on how deep the passwords we made are within the rockyou.txt file.\r\n\r\nIf this has run successfully, which it should, your next objective is to analyse the image we see...\r\n\r\n<img class=\"\" src=\"http://content.invisioncic.com/Mflaregames/monthly_10_2015/post-161-0-19506600-1445609356.jpeg\" width=\"458\" height=\"292\" />\r\n\r\nWe have an image named <strong>BlvckAr7.jpg</strong>, it appears to look like a normal jpeg file.

Maybe that could give us a lead?\r\n\r\nSo we download the exact same images we find, and we compare the sizes, using exiftool, notice the difference? One is bigger than the other right?\r\n\r\nLet's check the integrity of both files, using md5sum,\r\n\r\nWe can see there's a difference. Maybe it could be that this image was taken from another source, or something of the sort, regardless we have our suspicions. Let's assume there's another file inside of the S3CR37Z.jpg file, so let's now use steghide to extract what we may have in there.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>steghide extract -sf BlvckAr7.jpg</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>it's asking us for a passphrase, what do we do here!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLet's create a python file called StegCrack.py\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>##############################################</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>#\u00a0Created by Aslam Admani for Cybrary WannaCrack blog#</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>##############################################</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>import pexpect</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>import os</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>def Main():</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 PROMPT = ['$ ', \u00a0'# ', '&gt; ', '&gt;&gt; ']</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 f=open('~/Desktop/rockyou.txt', 'r')</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 for line in f.readlines():</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 pw = line.strip('n')</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 try:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 child = pexpect.spawn('steghide extract -sf S3CR37Z.jpg')</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 child.expect([pexpect.TIMEOUT, 'passphrase: ', 'Passphrase: ', 'password: '])</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 child.sendline(pw)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0child.expect(PROMPT)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0except:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0pass</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>if __name__ == '__main__':</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0 \u00a0 Main()</strong>\r\n\r\nThis should release the hidden file into the current directory, and now we should see a file called: <strong>S3CR37Z.txt</strong>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this script doesn't display the password to the output, however you can check out my github to see if there are any updates to these scripts.\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/c0d14k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/c0d14k</a>\r\n\r\nIf you're interested or need help, here's a video to show how to download and install Kali Linux on VMWare Player: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5mNnkG0FVk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5mNnkG0FVk</a>\r\n\r\n<em>Congratulations if you have completed this article, followed along and were sucessful!</em>\r\n\r\nComments and tips would be highly appreciated.",

Of those individuals, it seems a large number come to the exam with plenty of experience and assume they can get by on that alone. And while experience can certainly help, it's often the testing structure, questions, or wide range of material that can trip up even the most seasoned professional. That's where the Network+ practice test can help.You may be thinking that someone who has experience but can't pass may not be good at their job, or was lazy with their studies, but think back to high school taking the SATs. There are very few individuals who can sit an exam based on what they believe they know and pass with flying colors. Becoming a good test taker requires diligence and preparation for most.Today I sat for and passed the N10-006 Network+ exam. It was my first time sitting for the exam.It was a tough exam in light of how broad the content coverage is. I just made it (by percentage I passed by about 3-4 questions, like an 84%). There was material on the exam that I had never even heard of considering my preparation. But, as you can see, I passed. So it\u2019s possible if you put the time and effort in. And, some of you may likely have it far easier given your experience (I have zero).The Network+ exam doesn't get you on depth of material but on breadth of material. People with a lot of hands- on experience in the support sense may not have security knowledge. People with LAN experience may not have any WAN experience or infrastructure experience. My point is that it all requires study and the exam doesn't measure experience in every area but requires the candidate to gain knowledge to pass the exam.John Mulligan, Network AdministratorNot every test is directly tied to your experience, a fact which may help or hinder you.

        "post_teaser": "Of course, cyber security is important for all organizations, but sometimes, best practices are easier to implement for some companies than others, especially nonprofits. Operating with typically a smaller budget and a smaller staff, the costs and manpower needed to implement a strong data protection program can put a strain on a nonprofit, leaving the company open to vulnerabilities.Still, nonprofits store a ton of sensitive data including donor information, credit card information and staff employment and health insurance records, which need protection. For many in management roles at these organizations, it\u2019s hard to make guarding against an invisible threat a priority when you\u2019re already focused on helping others.It\u2019s important for nonprofits not to fall for any of the typical myths surrounding their data security, most specifically the myth that only \u2018large\u2019 nonprofits get hacked. \u00a0This is absolutely false. Hacker mentality shows that hackers will hack any system.According to CohnReznick\u2019s most recent Not-for-Profit Governance Survey,71% of not-for-profits surveyed have not conducted a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment to evaluate their technology exposure. In addition, 69% do not have a cybersecurity breach response plan in place.Security information and event management solutions delivered as a\u00a0service\u00a0\u201ccombines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). It provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.\u201dThat means, relevant security data about an enterprise\u2019s security is available in multiple locations and allows you to look at all the data from one point of view, making it easier to spot trends and see patterns that are out of the ordinary.In this model, the entire platform and infrastructure are outsourced to a service provider, meaning the customer (in this case the nonprofit) is only responsible for the content development within the SIEM application and the actual use of the data.Similarly, the costs of SIEM setup, such as licensing, installation and usually Professional Services consultancy are also moved towards the Service Provider, especially beneficial for an organization that wants predictable expenses or for those who do not have an extensive budget to justify the cost of setting up and SIEM environment.Perhaps most importantly, this model puts the development responsibility on the Service Provider, wherein they must maintain a team of developers, architects, and systems administrators to keep the platform operational and to make necessary changes.SIEM as a service is just one of many services offered by the revolutionary company, \u2018Invinsec\u2019 who provide rapid capability to organizations who face cyber-threats with little or no security capacity of their own; and we augment the capabilities of organizations who do have a security team.Invinsec was formed by two members of the UK and Ireland senior leadership team from a Big 4 Cybersecurity practice. Inspired by the belief that businesses deserve world-class security at affordable prices, they set about building a company that has grown rapidly and delivered excellent service to their growing client list. Invinsec is focused on the private and not-for-profit sectors.Among their 3 service packages offered, from BroadBot to BroadBot premium, they include SIEM as a service as a feature. To learn more, visit their website.At Cybrary, we\u2019re dedicated to teaching cyber security to anyone, anywhere who wants the opportunity to learn. We believe in addition services like those offered by Invinsec, a critical defense against security breaches starts with training individuals on best practices.If you are a nonprofit looking to start or train a security team, we encourage you to check out the Cybrary Teams platform. There, you can request a demo or speak to someone from our sales team who will help craft the right solution for your organization.Olivia Lynch\u00a0(@Cybrary_Olivia) is the Marketing Manager at Cybrary.

For many in management roles at these organizations, it\u2019s hard to make guarding against an invisible threat a priority when you\u2019re already focused on helping others.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important for nonprofits not to fall for any of the <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/avoiding-fraud/\">typical myths surrounding their data security</a>, most specifically the myth that only \u2018large\u2019 nonprofits get hacked. \u00a0This is absolutely false. Hacker mentality shows that hackers will hack any system.\r\n\r\nAccording to CohnReznick\u2019s most recent Not-for-Profit Governance Survey,\r\n<blockquote>71% of not-for-profits surveyed have not conducted a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment to evaluate their technology exposure. In addition, 69% do not have a cybersecurity breach response plan in place.</blockquote>\r\n<h3><strong>What is SIEM as a Service and How Can It Help?</strong></h3>\r\nSecurity information and event management solutions delivered as a\u00a0service\u00a0\u201ccombines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). It provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat means, relevant security data about an enterprise\u2019s security is available in multiple locations and allows you to look at all the data from one point of view, making it easier to spot trends and see patterns that are out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nIn this model, the entire platform and infrastructure are outsourced to a service provider, meaning the customer (in this case the nonprofit) is only responsible for the content development within the SIEM application and the actual use of the data.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the costs of SIEM setup, such as licensing, installation and usually Professional Services consultancy are also moved towards the Service Provider, especially beneficial for an organization that wants predictable expenses or for those who do not have an extensive budget to justify the cost of setting up and SIEM environment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most importantly, this model puts the development responsibility on the Service Provider, wherein they must maintain a team of developers, architects, and systems administrators to keep the platform operational and to make necessary changes.\r\n<h3><strong>I Want SIEM for My Organization, How Can I Get It?</strong></h3>\r\nSIEM as a service is just one of many services offered by the revolutionary company, \u2018Invinsec\u2019 who provide rapid capability to organizations who face cyber-threats with little or no security capacity of their own; and we augment the capabilities of organizations who do have a security team.\r\n\r\nInvinsec was formed by two members of the UK and Ireland senior leadership team from a Big 4 Cybersecurity practice. Inspired by the belief that businesses deserve world-class security at affordable prices, they set about building a company that has grown rapidly and delivered excellent service to their growing client list. Invinsec is focused on the private and not-for-profit sectors.\r\n\r\nAmong their 3 service packages offered, from BroadBot to BroadBot premium, they include SIEM as a service as a feature. To learn more, visit their <a href=\"https://www.invinsec.com/\">website.</a>\r\n<h3><strong>Secure All Companies</strong></h3>\r\nAt Cybrary, we\u2019re dedicated to teaching cyber security to anyone, anywhere who wants the opportunity to learn. We believe in addition services like those offered by Invinsec, a critical defense against security breaches starts with training individuals on best practices.\r\n\r\nIf you are a nonprofit looking to start or train a security team, we encourage you to check out the<a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/teams/?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=SIEM\"> Cybrary Teams</a> platform.

        "post_teaser": "Many products are available in the online marketing arena, which claims to repair and recover corrupted zip files. But, one necessary product is the best zip recovery software - used to retrieve lost data from a compressed file. Here, we will work for users to provide an error-free ZIP Repair tool to recover corrupted, inaccessible, and damaged compressed file data.Overview of Zip FilesZip is a file format that is used to archive data files and folders. It is basically a compressed file that supports lossless data compression. The file is widely used to compact large size files for internet transmission. The reduced size file can be easily transferred over the network. But, due to the wide use of a .zip file, it is prone to corruption, which makes it difficult for a simple computer user to access the file.\u00a0Once the .zip file gets broken or corrupted then, it's almost impossible to explore any data in that file. It creates a hazardous situation for every user if one can not uncompress the zip file and meanwhile, facing some kind of error. Reasons Behind ZIP File CorruptionThere are many causes that can corrupt .zip files and make them inaccessible. Some of them are provided below:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While sharing .zip files over a network, CRC errors can occur which may change the raw data of the compressed file, leading to zip file corruption.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Incomplete downloading of a compressed file can cause data corruption.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Malicious programs like viruses, trojans, etc., can also corrupt ZIP files that are stored on the machine\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sudden power failure during compressing or uncompressing data files or folders.\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If required disk space not available while uncompressing zip file then, files can get corrupted.\u00a0Corruption of ZIP Files does not mean that it is the end point to access damaged files. Depending on the reason for corruption there are many utilities that can repair zip files and recover items from the source files in a healthy state. In the following section, we'll cover one of the simplest ways to find a trusted solution to fix the issue.Zip Repair Tool: An Expert ApproachIf ZIP file gets corrupted or broken, then it is impossible to explore the WinZip file and hence, extraction of data gets difficult. Therefore, the only approach left is to use a Zip Repair tool, which is developed to repair corrupt or damaged ZIP files and extract data from them.

It is basically a compressed file that supports lossless data compression. The file is widely used to compact large size files for internet transmission. The reduced size file can be easily transferred over the network. But, due to the wide use of a .zip file, it is prone to corruption, which makes it difficult for a simple computer user to access the file.</span><span lang=\"EN-IN\" style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';\">\u00a0</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-IN\" style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';\">Once the .zip file gets broken or corrupted then, it's almost impossible to explore any data in that file.

        "post_teaser": "Across the site, there is plenty of discussion happening around what study tools users utilized in order to help them prepare for and pass an exam. Typically, Cybrarians use a variety of resources to ensure they\u2019ve covered all material and experienced a variety of question types. We\u2019d like to offer another resource to add to that list: The Security+ Practice Test.Today I passed the CompTIA Security+ exam - and I was quite surprised. I studied for two weeks using a myriad of sources, because of my ADHD I couldn't consistently stay in-tune with one series\u2026I was given 72 questions, and the first couple were simulations. Honestly, I was very intimidated by the fact that simulations were going to be on the exam... but I'm not sure if it was mere luck but the simulations I received were by a LARGE, COMFORTABLE margin easier than the scenario based \u2018word problems\u2019...Throughout the entire duration of the exam I felt like I was going to fail. A lot of the questioning was extremely different than any material I've ever encountered, which I guess is CompTIA's goal. But not only is the wording and questioning different, I noticed some of the jargon is different as well. In the end, despite being confident in the notion I was going to score somewhere in the 600s, I ended the exam with a solid 804.Adam Smith, Security AnalystSometimes, the format of questions will catch you off guard and you may not be prepared for questions you assumed would be easier than others, that\u2019s why test preparation is so important. It\u2019s also good to get a handle on the terminology that you will encounter when testing. \u00a0A practice test is especially useful in these cases.With the Security+ practice test, you gain 6 month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the test, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0 This Practice Test has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs. Select items by test objective, set study preferences and control how your answers are accessed.Select preset tests. These tests are made to provide a testing experience similar to a real testing environment. They are timed and filter questions like the certification exam. This option will help you determine your readiness for the certification exam.Flashcard review allows you to review concepts in a self-graded and unlimited environment.

        "post_content": "<h3><strong><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94208\" src=\"https://www.cybrary.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/young-professional.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /></strong></h3>\r\nAcross the site, there is plenty of discussion happening around what study tools users utilized in order to help them prepare for and pass an exam. Typically, Cybrarians use a variety of resources to ensure they\u2019ve covered all material and experienced a variety of question types. We\u2019d like to offer another resource to add to that list: The Security+ Practice Test.\r\n<h3><strong>Confidence is Key</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>Today I passed the CompTIA Security+ exam - and I was quite surprised. I studied for two weeks using a myriad of sources, because of my ADHD I couldn't consistently stay in-tune with one series\u2026\r\n\r\nI was given 72 questions, and the first couple were simulations. Honestly, I was very intimidated by the fact that simulations were going to be on the exam... but I'm not sure if it was mere luck but the simulations I received were by a LARGE, COMFORTABLE margin easier than the scenario based \u2018word problems\u2019...\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire duration of the exam I felt like I was going to fail. A lot of the questioning was extremely different than any material I've ever encountered, which I guess is CompTIA's goal. But not only is the wording and questioning different, I noticed some of the jargon is different as well. In the end, despite being confident in the notion I was going to score somewhere in the 600s, I ended the exam with a solid 804.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Adam Smith, Security Analyst</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nSometimes, the format of questions will catch you off guard and you may not be prepared for questions you assumed would be easier than others, that\u2019s why test preparation is so important. It\u2019s also good to get a handle on the terminology that you will encounter when testing. \u00a0A practice test is especially useful in these cases.\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Practice Test?</strong></h3>\r\nWith the Security+ practice test, you gain 6 month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the test, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0 This Practice Test has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs. Select items by test objective, set study preferences and control how your answers are accessed.</li>\r\n \t<li>Select preset tests. These tests are made to provide a testing experience similar to a real testing environment. They are timed and filter questions like the certification exam. This option will help you determine your readiness for the certification exam.</li>\r\n \t<li>Flashcard review allows you to review concepts in a self-graded and unlimited environment. With hundreds of questions, these premade flashcards will help you understand concepts covered on the actual certification exam.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><strong>How Will it Help Me Pass?</strong></h3>\r\nIf used correctly, the Security+ practice test will help you pass because it will ultimately give you a simulated exam in the same format with the same timing as a real exam. Often, we\u2019re not used to taking an exam in this manner, so it helps us feel comfortable that the material, not the environment, is the focus.

        "post_teaser": "NSA Contractor, Reality Winner (yes, that is her real name) was arrested on June 3rd for leaking classified information to an online news outlet, The Intercept. This document alleged that\u00a0the Russian General Main Staff Intelligence Directorate (GRU), had attempted to break into a company that sells voting registration equipment prior to the 2016 US presidential election.Although the document does not disclose\u00a0whether the hack had any impact on the outcome of the election, this leak is the latest in bad publicity for the NSA. In the Intercept report on June 5th, it claims in August 2016, Russia's military intelligence agency \"executed a cyber attack on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and sent spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials days before [the]\u00a0election,\"\u00a0as disclosed by an 'anonymous' source, who strangely enough had already been taken into custody. Yes,\u00a0Winner, who held a top-secret security clearance and worked as a government contractor in Georgia with Pluribus International, when confronted about the incident confessed immediately and was arrested before the article was even published. You may recall the Intercept as the site that has been publishing NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden since 2014, whom Winner had 'retweeted' prior to the incident.How was Winner caught so quickly? Well,\u00a0The Intercept contacted the NSA on May 30 and turned over a copy of the report to verify the authenticity of that document prior to publication. As it turns out, Winner emailed a printed and scanned copy of it to the publication, rather than emailing the PDF directly. According to security experts, newer printers print nearly invisible yellow dots that track down exactly when and where any document is printed. That allowed the FBI to discover that the document was from a printer with model number 54, serial number 29535218. The document was printed on May 9, 2017, at 6:20 and according to NSA record, they can tell who used the printer at that time. The FBI also found that Winner 'had email contact' with The Intercept. She is facing a count of 'gathering, transmitting or losing defense information,' and may get up to 10 years behind bars if she is convicted.Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors \u2026 executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions. \u2026 The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to \u2026 launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations. -NSA documentLet's explore some of the issues more thoroughly. Read 'Encryption Software and Combating Cyber Crime' for insight.In the digital world, even the unscammable can get scammed. That's what happened to those who invested in Bitcoin mining services from companies 'GAW Miners' and 'ZenMiner.' Now, con man\u00a0Homero Joshua Garza is paying the price after losing his case to the\u00a0United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\u00a0According to the SEC, Garza used the \"lure of quick riches\" in order to get about 10,000 people to invest in the bitcoin mining scheme, earning him about $20 million.\u00a0Bitcoin mining was originally used as a simple way to secure the virtual currency before the idea became popular. You need computational power to solve complex equations, and when these have been solved, you are awarded units of the virtual currency.\u00a0Homero Joshua Garza offered shares to investors in the companies' Bitcoin mining operation but did not own enough computing power for the mining promised. Instead, he used cash from new investors to reward earlier joiners, which is nothing but a fraudulent \"ponzi\" scheme, as described by the SEC.In the June\u00a02nd ruling, the US District of Connecticut federal court sided with SEC and agreed to order that both GAW Miners and ZenMiner pay $10,384,099 jointly in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, as well as $1,000,000 fees in damages. Since then, GAW Miners and ZenMiner companies have now been shut down, but the case against Garza is ongoing. \u00a0Keep in mind that the price of Bitcoin today is about $2,904 per coin. In 2014, when Garza began running the bogus schemes from his home in Connecticut, 1 BTC was equal to $450, meaning the $20 Million funds Garza took from the investors today worth around $150 million. A point that the Register has pointed out, saying \"there would have been more than enough to keep the investors happy and have millions of dollars still left in the bank.\" Looks like Bitcoin bit back. Ouch.Most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed -the SECYou've heard of mining, but what about blocking? Read 'Emerging Ransomware Threats' for details.This week, the US Supreme Court has agreed to take up the case against Timothy Ivory Carpenter, who was sentenced to 116 years in jail for robbing six cellular telephone stores at gunpoint, partially on the basis of months of cellphone location records, turned over without a warrant.\u00a0The outcome of this case could mean police would be required to obtain warrants to get cellphone location data pertaining to the phones of criminal suspects. According to Carpenter's lawyer, the prosecutor did not seek warrants based on probable cause, rather, they requested the records under the Stored Communications Act, which has a lower standard and allows phone companies to disclose records when the government shows \u201cspecific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that records at issue \u201care relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\" While the records do not reveal Carpenter's conversations, they do detail a five-month span in 2010 and 2011, when his cellphone connected with cell towers in the vicinity of the robberies.\u00a0The court argued that Carpenter had no reason to believe that his cellphone records would be kept private, given that the records simply show where his phone connected with cell towers, without giving away any information about call content.A US court had ruled that police could access phone location data without a warrant, but lower courts in many states, including Montana, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, have ruled the opposite. Their rulings indicate phone records are constitutionally protected. This is not the only cellphone related law that is under debate. In two similar cases in Florida, one defendant was sentenced to six months jail for allegedly refusing to reveal his iPhone passcode, while a second defendant walked free after he claimed he forgot his passcode. The United States Court ruled that police can force defendants to decrypt their electronic devices, as long as it does not violate the Fifth Amendment right that prevents any citizen from having to incriminate themselves. However, it appears US judges have different opinions on how to punish those who do not compel the order to unlock their phones. This could mean yet another decision for the Supreme Court in the future.Because cellphone location records can reveal countless private details of our lives, police should only be able to access them by getting a warrant based on probable cause. The time has come for the Supreme Court to make clear that the long-standing protections of the Fourth Amendment apply with undiminished force to these kinds of sensitive digital records. -Nathan Freed Wessler, an American Civil Liberties UnionWant more on the law's perspective?

For those serious about taking the CISSP exam, you\u2019ll want to ensure you pass on the first try.

Seeing as many Cybrary users are simply looking to get their start, it\u2019s only logical that I provide an overview for earning perhaps the most popular IT certification, the CompTIA A+ certification.The CompTIA A+ course hones in on the fundamentals of computer technology including repair, basic networking, installation and configuration of PCs, laptops and related hardware and configuration for mobile including Android and Apple.For those ultimately looking for a career in hacking or security, it is important to recognize that unless you are coming in with a thorough IT background, you will need to know the basics covered in the A+ first and work your way from there.Future hackers will most likely want to progress from CompTIA A+, to CompTIA Network+, to CompTIA Security+ before advancing to CSA+ or the CEH, and learn at least one programming language along the way, although there are varying opinions on this.So, for those starting at the beginning, I will provide a guide for earning your CompTIA A+ certification and point towards specific tools which will help you achieve success.The CompTIA A+ exam is designed to certify the competency of entry-level PC computer service professionals in installing, maintaining, customizing, and operating personal computers. Obtaining the certification validates entry-level IT skills in today\u2019s essential domains and ensures proper communication and customer service skills.How Does It Compare? If you don\u2019t believe you\u2019re ready to jump into the A+ exam, CompTIA also offers an \u2018IT Fundamentals\u2019 exam, code FC0-U51, which signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to identify and explain computer components, install software, establish network connectivity and prevent security risks. While it covers some similar topics as the A+, this exam is targeted more specifically for \u201cadvanced end-users and entry-level IT professionals.\u201dA similar certification also meant for beginners with less computer experience is the IC3 Digital Literacy Global Standard 5. This certification signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to effectively use some of the world\u2019s most current and prominent technologies. The exam is divided into 3 parts: computing fundamentals, living online, and key applications.Who Is A+ Intended For?This certification is meant to be the starting point for those looking to break into IT. As a standalone certification, it prepares individuals to fulfill call center, help desk and computer repair type jobs.When the knowledge from this certification is built upon, it can help individual move forward to learn networking, security, and even hacking. While not recommended for those looking for programming specific careers, general computer knowledge can always be useful.According to CompTIA \u201cIf you\u2019re new to the IT industry, this will help you put your best foot forward. And if you\u2019re already an IT professional, the CompTIA A+ certification validates your skills and can boost your career.\u201dWhy Should I Earn the A+ Certification? There are a variety of reasons why the A+ certification is a good choice for a credential to achieve. The A+ certification exam demands no prerequisites, introduces candidates to the essential IT domains, and is globally recognized as the mark of a skilled entry-level technician.Typically, the A+ certification is a mandatory hiring requirement for a variety of entry-level IT jobs and those who possess this certification are more likely to receive higher salaries. For example, on average, certified professionals make five to 15% more than their non-certified counterparts in the US.A+ certification is a requirement or elective in the advanced certification paths of leading technology vendors, including Microsoft, Cisco, Novell, HP, and IBM. Additionally, organizations such as the U.S. Department of Defense, Dell, Intel and Lenovo recognize this entry-level certification as validation\u00a0that an employee is competent to fulfill the roles of a support tech, service technician and support specialist.CompTIA A+ Exam Details The CompTIA A+ exam, as well as the A+ course on Cybrary were updated to reflect new content, designated by the exam codes: 220-901 and 220-902. Individuals must pass both exams in order to earn their certification.Exam 220-901 covers PC hardware and peripherals, mobile device hardware, networking and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity issues.\u00a0Testers must score 675 on a scale of 900 in order to pass.Exam 220-902 covers installing and configuring operating systems including Windows, iOS, Android, Apple OS X and Linux. It also addresses security, the fundamentals of cloud computing and operational procedures. Testers must score 700 on a scale of 900 in order to pass.Both exams consist of approximately 90 multiple-choice (single and multiple response), drag and drops, and performance based questions which testers have 90 minutes to complete.What is the difference between the 800 and 900 series?In general, the 220-901 exam is about 90% similar to the old 220-801 exam, while the 220-902 exam has been updated more thoroughly. Both exams together contain about 25% new content.The two exams are now more distinct and include less overlap. Mostly, there have been a few structural changes and more performance-based questions have been added.One main topic missing from the new exam is Windows 10. The 220-901 exam went from 5 exam domains to 4, with more emphasis on mobile devices (not just laptops) and a heavy emphasis on troubleshooting.The 220-902 exam added a domain, going from 4 to 5, with The Operational Procedures section added on, and the Troubleshooting section has been split into Hardware and Network Troubleshooting on the 220-901 exam and Software Troubleshooting on the 220-902 exam.Topics of EmphasisSecurityNetworkingMobile DevicesHardwareTroubleshootingWindows Operating SystemsOther operating systems and technologiesTechnical SupportAdditional A+ InformationThe CompTIA A+ is compliant with ISO 17024 standards and is approved by the U.S. Department of Defense to meet directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements. It is held by over 1 million individuals worldwide.According to CompTIA, \u201cSecurity isn\u2019t just for the security experts. IT professionals at every level need security knowledge and skills. You'll be able to spot security breaches, identify their origins and escalate threats more quickly than technicians who are not A+ certified.\u201dThat being said, this certification will offer an introduction to critical security concepts that will be solidified during later stages of security training, such as the Security+, so learning the basics early will only help with your studies at a later point.Recommendations from Testers \u201cCompTIA certifications buffed up my resume and landed me a great job. Not only did I gain knowledge in the field, I gained confidence and strategies for success in my career.\u201d\u2013 Tedley Meralus, IT support specialist, GeoGlobal Partners, LLC\u201cCompTIA certifications have not only boosted my salary, but have allowed me to progressively advance in my career as an IT professional.\u201d\u2013 Robert Kosydar, server systems administrator, U.S. Department of DefenseCybrary offers a full spectrum of preparation materials in order to ensure you become A+ certified.You can earn your certification in 4 easy steps:Take the A+ CourseLearn by watching the free online videos, which have been updated to reflect the 900 series and include material for both the 220-901 and 220-902 exams.Practice with a Virtual LabExplore critical concepts covered in the 220-902 and gain practical experience in a hands-on environment.Assess your Skills with the Practice TestsDive in to a simulated testing environment to receive analytics and feedback on your strengths and weaknesses with both the 200-901 and 220-902 practice exams.Certify Your SkillsWhen you\u2019re ready to take the test, purchase discounted exam vouchers for the 220-901 and 220-902 exams and schedule your tests at your nearest testing center.How Do I Renew My A+ Certification?

        "post_teaser": "Due to the recent malware issues that have plagued the Internet, our organization made the decision to upgrade the current version of the protocol Server Message Block (SMB) to version 2.\u00a0 This caused an authentication issue between the users and the filers in which the data is stored.Before I explain the fix, let\u2019s discuss what SMB is.\u00a0 SMB is a protocol which provides a means for user applications in their computing device to be able to read and write to the files located on the filers.\u00a0 The SMB protocol can be used over the Internet either on top of its Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) or on top of other network protocols such as NetBEUI and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPE).\u00a0 (Rouse, 2007).After the protocol was upgraded, since customers were already logged onto the network, no difference was noticed.\u00a0 However, after lunch, when users started to log back into their systems, it was noticed that the connection to the network drives had been lost and the ability to manually map the drives were unsuccessful.\u00a0 By the following morning, after all\u00a0the systems were forced to reboot during the evening, all users had lost their connectivity to the filers.After much research and looking over blog sites, I was able to find an idea for a fix for this issue and since it is not in print, I pass the knowledge on to you.You will need to log onto the filers via an SSH session by using a local account; Putty or SecureCRT will work just fine for this.\u00a0 If you do not have a local account on the filers, you may want to fix this issue now.Once you have logged on, at the prompt, type in the following:Filer name>options ciifs cifs.smb showYou should see all of the current CIFS protocols that are currently associated with your filer.\u00a0 If the SMB2 client protocol has never been turned on, you may not see this line, so that was my problem.\u00a0 At the prompt, type in the following:Filer name>options cifs.smb2.client.enable on then ENTER.Within ten minutes, have your users log off and back on and the connection to their files will be re-established.\u00a0 This will need to be done on each filer, including your backups, to fix this issue.I am aware that this does NOT work on the EMC2 filers, but I hope that this points you in the right direction.\u00a0 Good luck.Resources-Rouse, M.

        "post_teaser": "Nowadays everyone uses the internet - most commonly through WIFI \u00a0(wireless fidelity). Wifi is a short-range wireless transmission technology that can send signals up to hundreds of feet away to support access to the Internet. But what about the security of our data which is easily breached by any attacker through these airwaves. In this article, I mainly concentrate on the hacking of Wifi passwords which is the first step of taking the privacy of our confidential data. In WIFI there are two main devices used as a wireless client and an access point (router) which gives us radio signals to connect to the internet.An attack on a WIFI network can be divided into two classes:1. On network access control, data confidentiality and data integrity protection.2. On wireless communication network design, deployment, and maintenance.These attacks are performed due to the weaknesses in wireless security protocols, Access Point broadcast message feature or much more. The access point broadcast feature can be performed on a physical\u00a0access point. But wireless protocol weaknesses are still a very common vulnerability which can easily perform the attacks because these protocols are mainly used for encryption, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of packets or data. There are\u00a0three main wireless protocols used:1. WEP (Wired Equivalency Privacy )+ RC42. WPA(Wi-Fi Protected Access)+TKIP3. WPA2(Wi-Fi Protected Access Version 2)+AES(WPA and WPA2 are counted as 1 in this list).4. OPEN(no password)In WEP, Confidentiality is provided from the encryption of the frame body using RC4 algorithm, Integrity is maintained through the Integrity Check Algorithm (CRC), and Authentication is provided by the use of a shared key that is only known by authorized users on the network.WEP WEAKNESSES:1. The Size of IV (RC4 Key) is short and reused.2. Problem in the RC4 algorithm itself (outdated algorithm).3. Easy forging of authentication messages.4. WEP does not Prevent forgery of packets due to plain text of IV\u2019s5. WEP does not prevent replay attacks. An attacker can simply record and replay packets as desired due to key size is very short.\u00a0WPA came with the purpose of solving the problems in the WEP cryptography method, without the user needing to change the hardware. The standard WPA, similar to WEP, specifies two operation manners: WPAPSK (Pre-Shared Key) that is used for small office and home/domestic use, authentication which does not use an authentication server and the data cryptography key can go up to 256 bits. Unlike WEP, this can be any alphanumeric string and is used only to negotiate the initial session with the AP. Because both the client and the AP already possess this key, WPA provides mutual authentication, and the key is never transmitted over the air. \u00a0Another one is Enterprise WPA or Commercial. In this, authentication is made by an authentication server 802.1x, generating excellent control and security in the users' traffic on the wireless network. This WPA uses 802.1X+EAP for authentication, but again replaces WEP with the more advanced TKIP encryption. No preshared key is used here, but you will need a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server for data transfer.WPA IMPROVEMENTS:1. A cryptographic message integrity code, or MIC, called Michael, to defeat forgeries.2. A new IV sequencing discipline, to remove replay attacks from the attacker\u2019s arsenal.3. A per-packet key mixing function, to de-correlate the public IVs from weak keys.4. TKIP (Temporary Key Integrity Protocol) is used for encryption instead of RC4.WPA WEAKNESSES:1. \u201cWeakness in Passphrase Choice in WPA Interface\u201d, reveal the passphrase by performing a dictionary attack against WPA-PSK networks by capturing the four-way authentication handshake.2. TKIP protocol also has the weakness.In WPA2 Encryption is done using AES algorithm, authentication using EAP-TLS protocol and data integrity using CCMP (Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol). In WPA2-PSK , a pre-shared secret is used, much like WEP or WPA. Access points and clients are all manually configured to use the same secret of up to 64 ASCII characters, such as \u201cthis_is_our_secret_password\" and WPA2 corporate security is based on 802.1X (the EAP authentication framework including RADIUS server).The main problem of WPA as a pairwise solved by divided the type of security to three categories:1. The pairwise cipher suite used to encrypt unicast (point-to-point) traffic.2. The group cipher suite used to encrypt multicast and broadcast (point-to-multipoint) traffic.3. The use of either a pre-shared key (PSK, or \u201chome user\u201d security, using a shared secret) or 802.1X authentication.WPA2 WEAKNESSES:1. AES-128 bits protocol is breakable, but it takes a lot of time.2. Moderate security due to the insider attacks (group transient key is broadcasted to all the clients which means all clients connected to particular AP having same group key).3. Stealth mode ARP Poisoning/Spoofing attack is possible.WPA2 SOLUTIONS:1. Use endpoint security.2. Use wireless traffic monitoring using WIPS sensors.There are various tools available today which are used for breaking the WEP, WPA, WPA2 protocols as aireplay-ng .",

With so many certifications available, it\u2019s hard to know where to begin, which are most reputable and what is best for your specific career goals.The answer, as I\u2019ve said, isn\u2019t one size fits all. But, I\u2019m hoping to make it easier to make these critical decisions by compiling information surrounding some of the most popular topics on the site.Recently, I\u2019ve discussed CSA+ vs. CEH and MCSA vs. MCSE, and tried to differentiate between the two. Since these posts have published, we\u2019ve seen an influx of requests regarding the PMP.In this post, I\u2019ll discuss the route to becoming PMP certified, including more entry level certifications, like CAPM and CompTIA Project+.As you may or may not know, the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from PMI is the gold standard of project management credentials. In order to obtain your PMP, there are few things to keep in mind:The prerequisites for taking the PMP exam are a secondary degree (high school diploma, associate\u2019s degree or the global equivalent), 7,500 hours leading and directing projects, and 35 hours of project management education,\u00a0or\u00a0a four-year degree, 4,500 hours leading and directing projects, and 35 hours of project management education.Where Should I Start?If you\u2019re not ready or unable to meet the prerequisites for the PMP at this time, there are two other project management certifications you can take to get started: the Certified Associate In Project Management (CAPM) from PMI or the Project+ from CompTIA.Through 2020, 1.57 million new jobs will be created each year and among those, qualified management practitioners are in high demand.\u00a0Whether you have a technical background or work in an enterprise environment and are looking to assume a leadership role, management is a skill every professional needs.Among survey respondents to PMI\u2019s Earning Power Salary Survey, those with a PMP certification garner a higher salary (20% higher on average) than those without a PMP certification.Similarly, CompTIA reports \u201cProject Management is fourth in specialized skills in IT job postings. It is also the third hottest in demand tech skill with 39% of respondents with hiring plans said they will be seeking people with this skill in the next 12 months.\u201dDesigned for those with less project experience, the CAPM is intended to demonstrate candidates' understanding of the fundamental knowledge, terminology and processes of effective project management.According to PMI, \u201cIf you\u2019d like to manage larger projects and gain more responsibility or add project management skills into your current role, then the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) is right for you.\u201dWhat are the Prerequisites? Similar to the PMP, PMI has implemented fairly strict requirement before one can sit for the certification exam. The prerequisites for taking the CAPM exam are a secondary degree (high school diploma, associate\u2019s degree or the global equivalent)\u00a0and\u00a01,500 hours of project experience\u00a0or\u00a023 hours of project management education completed by the time you sit for the exam.CAPM Exam DetailsThe certification exam has 150 multiple choice questions which testers have three hours to complete.What Does Earning the CAPM Mean?Obtaining your certification signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to\u00a0manage all aspects of any project, regardless of scope, budget and time constraints.What Tools Does Cybrary Offer In Preparation for the CAPM? Cybrary offers a\u00a0\u2018Practical Project Management Course\u2019 as well as the CAPM practice test.Project+ validates the ability to initiate, manage and support a project or business initiative. Project+ is designed for any individual who wants to validate project management experience.What are the Prerequisites? CompTIA Project+ requires no prerequisites or application submission. Also, the need of continuous education upgrading is not required.Instead, they recommend one year of managing, directing or participating in small- to medium-scale projects prior to pursuing this certification.Project+ Exam DetailsThe certification exam, code PK0-003, has 100 multiple choice and drag/drop questions which testers have 90 minutes to complete. You must receive a score of 710 or higher out of 900 in order to pass.What Does Earning the Project+ Mean? Obtaining your certification signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to\u00a0initiate, manage and support a project or business initiative.What Tools Does Cybrary Offer In Preparation for the Project+? Cybrary offers a \u2018Practical Project Management Course\u2019 as well as the Project+ practice test.As you can see, the prerequisites for the CAPM exam may make this certification less attainable for many.While the CAPM may appear to be a better option since it is also developed by PMI, the Project+ was developed on the same PMBOK (project management body of knowledge), meaning it covers the same information as the CAPM, and both require passing only 1 test to become certified.In a write up from ExamCollection.com, they say, \u201cCompared to the CAPM, Project+ comes from a computing industry-spanning organization that develops its certification programs based on the needs and input from industry stakeholders, from leading IT companies to government organizations, education institutions etc. This way, CompTIA Project+ credential targets the needs of project management with a special focus on the IT industry \u2013 which adds a huge value to this certification.\u201dAlthough some many consider the Project+ may seem less valuable to some, it is just as good of a stepping stone to PMP as the CAPM is. CAPM offers more of a challenge, but Project+ is more IT industry focused, which may be a defining factor for those looking to work as a technical PM.For those who meet the previously mentioned requirements needed for PMP and are considering preparing for the certification exam, we will cover everything you need to get certified.According to PMI, \u201cIf you\u2019re an experienced project manager responsible for all aspects of project delivery, leading and directing cross-functional teams, then the PMP is the right choice for you.\u201dThroughout your PMP training, you will cover and subsequently be tested on:Management and processes in contextIntegration managementScope managementTime managementCost managementQuality managementHuman Resource managementCommunication managementRisk managementProcurement managementStakeholder managementAdditional PMP InformationPMP has over 500,000 active certified holders.PMP Exam DetailsThe certification exam has 200 multiple choice questions which testers have four hours to complete. It is known for being an especially difficult exam.What Does Earning the PMP Mean? Obtaining your certification signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to\u00a0initiate, plan and manage a project, control the process behind analyzing risk, monitor and control project contracts and develop schedules and budgets.It also \u201csignifies that you speak and understand the global language of project management and connects you to a community of professionals, organizations and experts worldwide.\u201dWhat Tools Does Cybrary Offer In Preparation for the Project+? Cybrary offers a \u2018Project Management Professional Course\u2019 as well as a PMP practice test.According to PMI, \u201cFormal project management education means classes and training, online, virtual or face-to-face, that are run by a reputable vendor. That could be a community college, university, national training provider, a local firm or a training business operating entirely online. If you don't know whether your chosen provider is reputable, ask around or read some reviews. It's important because if you are audited you'll need their support in the form of a certificate of attendance or similar.\u201dNot only are project management certifications in high demand, but they come with a variety of options for those looking to get the experience and stand out in the talent pool.The Project+ has no prerequisites and is geared towards IT professionals.The CAPM has strict prerequisites and is therefore considered to be more challenging.The PMP has strict prerequisites but is considered the gold standard of project management certifications.Want More Posts Comparing Certifications?Leave a comment describing what you\u2019d like to learn more about.Olivia Lynch\u00a0(@Cybrary_Olivia) is the Marketing Manager at Cybrary.

        "post_teaser": "If there is one person who approves of Trump\u2019s recently signed executive order, its former president Obama.Why, you ask? A side by side comparison of Obama's and Trump's policy and it\u2019s clear. Trump simply mandated compliance of Obama\u2019s 2013 executive order within 90 days. While his tactic of \u201cdo what the other guy did\u201d is nothing innovative for American policy, it does validate the precedent set by his presidential predecessor.On May 11th Donald Trump signed an executive order carrying forward his predecessor\u2019s policy and mandated that all federal agencies have 90 days to adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, among other requirements. For executives required to adopt the framework, there are a few things you should know. Mainly, how it provides a mechanism for organizations to:1) Describe their current cybersecurity posture2) Describe their target state for cybersecurity3) Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process4) Assess progress toward the target state5) Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity riskNo executive administration in America\u2019s history had to confront cybersecurity as a national priority the way Obama did. The myriad of prolific Obama era cyber-attacks were more frequent, farther reaching and sophisticated.The Obama administration came up with a plan to address the defense of America's digital infrastructure. It was the first of its kind drafted by a president who recognized the need to secure America\u2019s newly developed cyber frontier.\u00a0The directive came equipped with the largest multibillion-dollar investment in American cyber security. Intended to establish a cybersecurity framework, the original policy tasked the:\u201cNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to lead the development of a framework to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure.\u201dThe unprecedented legislation also gave rise to a new breed of partnerships between the public and private sector. A partnership rooted not in silos but sharing of information regarding cyber security risks. The result paved way for the first, NIST sponsored, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) known as the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). Affectionately known by the industry as \u201cthe center\u201d, the NCCoE served as the nexus of collaboration for America\u2019s tech giants, government agencies, and academia to mitigate cybersecurity risks in as they applied to specific economic sectors.With an overnight budget of $5 billion, The Center cemented itself as a new breed of cyber unicorn, solidifying Obama's vision for securing the nation's critical infrastructure.In January, President Donald Trump committed to developing a national cybersecurity strategy in 80 days. With a large focus on workforce development. The order mandates:\"Agency heads shall show preference in their procurement for shared IT services, to the extent permitted by law, including email, cloud, and cyber security services.Further, the United States seeks to support the growth and sustainment of a workforce that is skilled in cyber security and related fields as the foundation for achieving our objectives in cyberspace.Workforce Development.\u00a0In order to ensure that the United States maintains a long-term cyber security advantage:(A)\u00a0jointly assess the scope and sufficiency of efforts to educate and train the American cyber security workforce of the future, including cybersecurity-related education curricula, training, and apprenticeship programs, from primary through higher education; and(B)\u00a0within 120 days of the date of this order, provide a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, with findings and recommendations regarding how to support the growth and sustainment of the Nation's cybersecurity workforce in both the public and private sectors.(C)\u00a0review the workforce development efforts of potential foreign cyber peers in order to help identify foreign workforce development practices likely to affect long-term United States cyber security competitiveness\"This long-delayed policy is an effort to secure porous federal networks, create framework focused security activities, and develop a cyber-savvy workforce.So how does one prepare a cyber-workforce for the future?Imagine an online platform that provides a combination of training, assessment, and communication. A solution that integrates security assessments into your workforce. A security tool designed to enhance the learning experience. A platform where information sharing actually increases security. A tool that empowers the American workforce. As a member of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Excellence (NICE) Certifications and Training Workgroup, Cybrary is poised to fill the gap in today\u2019s cyber workforce development.Start today by assessing your team on NIST's Risk Management Framework at no cost.You can learn more about Cybrary's security training resources including the latest course on the Risk Management Framework here.Thomas Callahan is a Software Engineer at Cybrary passionate about bridging the cyber security skills gap.\u00a0",

While his tactic of \u201cdo what the other guy did\u201d is nothing innovative for American policy, it does validate the precedent set by his presidential predecessor.\r\n\r\nOn May 11th Donald Trump signed an executive order carrying forward his predecessor\u2019s policy and mandated that all federal agencies have 90 days to adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, among other requirements. For executives required to adopt the framework, there are a few things you should know. Mainly, how it provides a mechanism for organizations to:\r\n\r\n<em>1) Describe their current cybersecurity posture</em>\r\n\r\n<em>2) Describe their target state for cybersecurity</em>\r\n\r\n<em>3) Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process</em>\r\n\r\n<em>4) Assess progress toward the target state</em>\r\n\r\n<em>5) Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk</em>\r\n<h3><strong>OBAMA\u2019S CYBERSECURITY LEGACY</strong></h3>\r\nNo executive administration in America\u2019s history had to confront cybersecurity as a national priority the way Obama did. The myriad of prolific Obama era cyber-attacks were more frequent, farther reaching and sophisticated.\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration came up with a plan to address the defense of America's digital infrastructure. It was the first of its kind drafted by a president who recognized the need to secure America\u2019s newly developed cyber frontier.\u00a0The directive came equipped with the largest multibillion-dollar investment in American cyber security. Intended to establish a cybersecurity framework, the original policy tasked the:\r\n<blockquote><em>\u201cNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to lead the development of a framework to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure.\u201d</em></blockquote>\r\nThe unprecedented legislation also gave rise to a new breed of partnerships between the public and private sector. A partnership rooted not in silos but sharing of information regarding cyber security risks. The result paved way for the first, NIST sponsored, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) known as the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). Affectionately known by the industry as \u201cthe center\u201d, the NCCoE served as the nexus of collaboration for America\u2019s tech giants, government agencies, and academia to mitigate cybersecurity risks in as they applied to specific economic sectors.\r\n\r\nWith an overnight budget of $5 billion, The Center cemented itself as a new breed of cyber unicorn, solidifying Obama's vision for securing the nation's critical infrastructure.\r\n<h3>THE NEED FOR CYBER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT</h3>\r\nIn January, President Donald Trump committed to developing a national cybersecurity strategy in 80 days. With a large focus on workforce development. The order mandates:\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"</em></strong><em>Agency heads shall show preference in their procurement for shared IT services, to the extent permitted by law, including email, cloud, and cyber security services.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Further, the United States seeks to support the growth and sustainment of a workforce that is skilled in cyber security and related fields as the foundation for achieving our objectives in cyberspace.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Workforce Development.\u00a0In order to ensure that the United States maintains a long-term cyber security advantage:</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(A)\u00a0jointly assess the scope and sufficiency of efforts to educate and train the American cyber security workforce of the future, including cybersecurity-related education curricula, training, and apprenticeship programs, from primary through higher education; and</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(B)\u00a0within 120 days of the date of this order, provide a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, with findings and recommendations regarding how to support the growth and sustainment of the Nation's cybersecurity workforce in both the public and private sectors.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(C)\u00a0review the workforce development efforts of potential foreign cyber peers in order to help identify foreign workforce development practices likely to affect long-term United States cyber security competitiveness\"</em>\r\n\r\nThis long-delayed policy is an effort to secure porous federal networks, create framework focused security activities, and develop a cyber-savvy workforce.\r\n<h3>THE CYBER WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE</h3>\r\n<em>So how does one prepare a cyber-workforce for the future?</em>\r\n\r\nImagine an online platform that provides a combination of training, assessment, and communication. A solution that integrates security assessments into your workforce. A security tool designed to enhance the learning experience. A platform where information sharing actually increases security. A tool that empowers the American workforce.

        "post_teaser": "\u00a0In this article, I will use the term \"pentester\" or \"attacker\" for the same intent. The intent is to denote the one attacking the system. This means to compromise it by a hacker, or to secure it with a penetration tester.\u00a0Penetration testing (or pen testing) is the art of detecting, assessing and exploiting vulnerabilities found on a network or computer system. It is the most advanced technique used by security specialists to prove that a system is vulnerable and its vulnerabilities are exploitable by a malicious insider or outsider.\u00a0To perform an effective penetration test, use of a methodology is recommended.\u00a0A penetration testing methodology (or pen testing framework) is a set of basic steps that a pentester should observe to get results. Results can be validated later by another penetration tester.\u00a0In this field of ideas, many penetration testing methodologies have been imagined and formalized by professionals, including, but not limited to the following:\u00a0OSSTMM: Open Source Security Threat Management MethodologyISSAF: Information Systems Security Assessment FrameworkNIST SP 800-115 technical guide to information security testing and assessmentOWTF: Offensive Web Testing Framework\u00a0But, there are some limits to these traditional methodologies. The pentester's creativity can be hindered due to the need to cope with pre-defined steps. These methodologies rarely consider why a pen test is being taken or what the critical data is that needs\u00a0protecting by a company.\u00a0To address these problems a new methodology has been created, which view the network from an attacker point of view: The kill chain.\u00a0The Attacker\u2019s Kill Chain:\u00a0During a conference on Cyber Security in 2009, a Lockheed Martin researcher, Mike Cloppert, created the concept know as Attacker\u2019s Kill Chain. This new framework takes into account all the steps an adversary can take while attacking a network.\u00a0A simple scheme of the attacker kill chain is from Robert W. Beggs' book.\u00a0Now we are going to explain in detail the phases of the attacker kill chain.\u00a0The Reconnaissance Phase:This phase is the first stage of an attack. Here is where the attacker will collect as much information as possible on the target system before attacking it. Thus, an estimated 70 percent of the \u2018work effort\u2019 of a penetration test or attack is conducting reconnaissance. This phase is composed of two sub-phases: Passive and Active Reconnaissance.\u00a0Passive Reconnaissance:In this phase, the attacker will collect publicly available information on the target. This includes everything from public websites and social media pages, to current employee names and other aspects. These pieces of information help to construct the \u2018Attack surface\u2019 of the target. It will serve to guess user passwords or login information using social engineering. It is called passive reconnaissance because it is very difficult to detect since it is not too different from regular user behavior.\u00a0Active Reconnaissance:Unlike the passive method, this reconnaissance can be detected by the target. The activities included in this phase can include visiting target premises, port scanning, and remote vulnerability scanning.\u00a0The Delivery Phase:During this step, the pentester develops and deploys the weapon he will use during the attack. The weapon used here will depend on the attack surface found (ethernet, wifi, public website, etc.), and the attacker's intent.\u00a0The Exploit Phase: In this phase, the attacker applies a particular exploit on the target and can thus reach his goal. It can be a single phase (for example, exploiting a known vulnerability in the system) or many phases. For example, if an attacker accesses the phone book of an organization, then uses it to generate a brute-force attack on a password, he could also use it to send emails to employees with a crafted pdf file.\u00a0In real life, multi-phase attacks are the norm to have a better chance of success.\u00a0Post-Exploitation: Action on the Objective\u00a0In this phase, assume that the exploit phase was a success, and now you have to choose the actions you can conduct on the target. At this level, the attacker can steal sensitive data, financial information, cause a denial of service, or even escalate privileges.\u00a0Another post exploitation activity is often persistence. This means that the attacker finds a way to persist with access on the target to have access to the target when needed.\u00a0Note: When performing a pen test, security is an important concern. To stay anonymous while performing a reconnaissance phase, have a look at my previous article: \"Anonymously Scan a Remote Website using Nmap.\"\u00a0Thanks for reading this article.\u00a0References:Mastering Kali Linux for Advanced Penetration Testing \u2013 R.
