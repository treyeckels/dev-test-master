While the CEH is ideal for that, you will want to have prior security knowledge before jumping right into the exam. If you have some security knowledge already and need a way to gauge your skills before the exam, a CEH practice exam can help you in deciding if this is the right exam for you to pursue at the moment.\r\n<h3><strong>Confidence is Key</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>I passed my test earlier this morning. I'm a front-end web developer. I've been doing work as a Govt. contractor for about 7 or 8 years now. I don't have much security background aside from getting my Security+ cert in 2013 for no real reason other than it interested me and would my resume. I took the latest version of Sec+ earlier this year to renew it, and I started my CEH journey because an upcoming contract requires Sec+ and CEH to meet DOD 8570 certification requirements.\r\n\r\nI spent about 3 months preparing at a slower pace, but you could easily do it quicker than that. <em>A lot</em> of the CEH body of knowledge is stuff you'll see with Security+ and other basic certs. It's definitely a good idea to have some sort of foundation, whether through certs or job experience. For example, does ethical hacking use bollards? Not technically. Will you still see questions about stuff like that? Yes.\r\n\r\nI finished the whole thing in about 90 minutes, with 60 to answer all the questions, and 30 to review all my answers, plus the few flagged questions. Overall, I'd say this exam is easier than the latest version of Security+. You could essentially call it Security+ with some questions about specific tools + output, and vulnerabilities, IMO.\r\n\r\nI know the exam can sound intimidating, and it tends to get played up and made larger than it is, but you shouldn't be scared. I recommend browsing Kali's tool list and knowing a lot of those at the basic level. Aside from tools and attack types, you should know your general security principles like defense-in-depth, getting permission before hacking, etc.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Brendan Zhu, Web Developer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nBrendan offers a good overview of what content knowledge is needed to prepare for the test. Perhaps his best piece of advice is not to hype the exam up to bigger than it is, or let fear overwhelm you from being successful. Study at the pace that is right for your specific needs, but don’t procrastinate.\r\n\r\nIf you want to dive further into the type of content you’ll find on the CEH exam, you may want to consider the CEH practice exam.\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Practice Exam?</strong></h3>\r\nWith the CEH practice exam, you gain 6-month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the exam, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.  This Practice Exam has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs. Select items by test objective, set study preferences and control how your answers are accessed.</li>\r\n \t<li>Select preset tests. These tests are made to provide a testing experience similar to a real testing environment. They are timed and filter questions like the certification exam. This option will help you determine your readiness for the certification exam.</li>\r\n \t<li>Flashcard review allows you to review concepts in a self-graded and unlimited environment. With hundreds of questions, these premade flashcards will help you understand concepts covered on the actual certification exam.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><strong>How Will it Help Me Pass?</strong></h3>\r\nIf used correctly, the practice exam will help you pass because it will ultimately give you a simulated exam in the same format with the same timing as a real exam. Often, we’re not used to taking an exam in this manner, so it helps us feel comfortable that the material, not the environment, is the focus. It all goes back to confidence.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you get feedback specific to topic areas that need improvement so you can spend time reviewing what you don’t know rather than wasting time going over all the content.\r\n\r\nWe recommend first going through the exam in assessment mode (option 2, as listed above) to see what you know and don’t know going into the exam. Then, use options 1 and 3 to hone in on specific topics that need improvement. Lastly, go through option 2 as many times as needed until you feel comfortable going into the real test.\r\n<h3><strong>Transcender CEH Practice Exam Reviews</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>I found the Transcender Exams to be fantastic! The questions were more intense than the actual Ethical Hacker exam, and I felt were a tremendous learning tool. It has become a common practice for the training staff at our company to recommend your products. Thanks!\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>R.R.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI took the exam this weekend and passed and I simply would not have without the Transcender practice material. I used the Transcender CEH practice study material most for the areas that I was the weakest. I actually ended up scoring better on those sections than those I have always done well on. I felt that the Transcender material covered the concepts and details necessary to properly face this tough exam.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>T.W.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<em>*Note: These are real testimonials taken from the Transcender website.

More specifically, which test format is best to guarantee you’ll pass. While that answer is entirely dependent on the individual, the CCNA Practice Test can be a valuable resource in helping you to evaluate where your knowledge lies and choosing the format that coincides best.\r\n<h3><strong>Confidence is Key</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>So today I passed the 200-125 (the composite CCNA exam). I was a little too nervous at the start of the exam.\r\n\r\nTo give some background, I'm just over 3 years (and 3 jobs) into my professional IT career, and this will be the first IT certification I hold. My third job (a Fortune 100 company that I guarantee everybody has heard of) placed a very heavy emphasis on obtaining my CCNA.\r\n\r\nAt the start I felt (Oh, it's not as easy as I thought). Then there was that section with simulations where you answer a few questions. It first gives you instructions on how to use it then you're supposed to click on the questions tab and so... I clicked on NEXT thinking it would bring up the questions, but what happened was it took empty answers for all of them and went to the next section and you cannot go back. At this point I felt really really really frustrated! I lost all those points without even going through the questions.\r\n\r\nThen I told myself \"It's a silly little easy exam! I don't need those missed points anyway.” Went ahead, finished the remaining questions and had about 10 minutes left I think at the end. I got 830 and the pass was 810. Not sure how many questions accounted for those 20 points.\r\n\r\nIt's all about knowing the basics really. For example, you need to know two routers interfaces must be setup in the same area to establish OSPF.\r\n\r\nMostly I liked the simulations where you need to run show commands for troubleshooting! That part was awesome! It was so fluid tapping into the routers and navigating and running those lovely show commands. I found it easier to use than even packet tracer!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I think the advice about taking the exams separately still holds true if you're brand new to networking. As I said before, I have three years of professional experience to work with; not all of that was networking-based, but coming into my studies, I already knew what a MAC address and IP address was, the basics of subnetting, the roles of a router and switch, and so on. If you're thinking about pursuing a CCNA and have similar experience, then the composite exam will provide a decent challenge; otherwise, I would advise you stick with the separate exams.</blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>John Driscoll, Network Administrator</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLessons learned from John’s experience include determining which testing format is right for you; taking the exam in two parts or as one comprehensive tests. Practice tests can help determine which will be best.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you’ll experience what it’s like to go through the testing questions before it really counts so nuances such as a ‘next’ button won’t hinder you on the real exam. Chances are, when taking the exam for the first time, you’ll fluctuate between whether or not you think the exam is easy. Stay confident and trust in your preparation. After all, no one knows how you study best except you. Use every tool at your disposal.\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Practice Test?</strong></h3>\r\nWith the A+ practice test, you gain 6-month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the exam, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.  This Practice Test has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs.

I have used every major exam preparation tool during my thirteen years in the IT industry and have found Transcender to be the most accurate and up-to-date product on the market. I recommend Transcender products to all of my colleagues and have seen the same exam success rate in their careers as a result. With a complete line of training tools including TranscenderCert, TranscenderFlash, and TransTrainer, Transcender gives the IT professional the long-term knowledge necessary to excel in the IT industry, not just the information needed to pass an exam.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>T.W.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI'm delighted to see that you guys will actually act upon feedback from the field. It's not as common a phenomenon as I would like it to be.

This is the latest of the Vault 7 leaks, released June 15th. </b>\r\n\r\nSomeone with a green thumb must have named 'Cherry Blossom,'  a framework being used by the CIA for monitoring the Internet activity of the targeted systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi devices. Apparently developed alongside the Stanford Research Institute (SRI International), an American nonprofit research institute, as part of its ‘Cherry Bomb’ project, 'Cherry Blossom' is a remotely controllable firmware-based implant for wireless networking devices, including routers and wireless access points (APs). Using 'Cherry Blossom, you can exploit router vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and then replace firmware with custom 'Cherry Blossom' firmware. Once the firmware is in place, an implanted device, 'Flytrap,' can then be used to monitor the internet activity of and deliver software exploits to targets of interest.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wikileaks, \"CIA hackers use Cherry Blossom hacking tool to hijack wireless networking devices on the targeted networks and then perform man-in-the-middle attacks to monitor and manipulate the Internet traffic of connected users.\" After you've gained control of the wireless device, 'Cherry Blossom' reports back to CIA controlled command-and-control server referred as 'Cherry Tree,' where it receives instructions and performs malicious tasks including: monitoring network traffic to collect email addresses, chat user names, MAC addresses, and VoIP numbers, redirecting connected users to malicious websites, setting up VPN tunnels to access clients connected to Flytrap's WLAN/LAN for further exploitation, and copying of the full network traffic of a targeted device.  In a list from the Hacker News, they state: \"'Cherry Blossom' has the ability to exploit vulnerabilities in hundreds of Wi-Fi devices manufactured by the following vendors: Belkin, D-Link, Linksys, Aironet/Cisco, Apple AirPort Express, Allied Telesyn, Ambit, AMIT Inc, Accton, 3Com, Asustek Co, Breezecom, Cameo, Epigram, Gemtek, Global Sun, Hsing Tech, Orinoco, PLANET Technology, RPT Int, Senao, US Robotics and Z-Com.\"\r\n<blockquote>The wireless device itself is compromised by implanting a customized CherryBlossom firmware on it; some devices allow upgrading their firmware over a wireless link, so no physical access to the device is necessary for a successful infection. -Wikileaks</blockquote>\r\nFor a full perspective on all sides of the Wikileaks debate read, <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/wikileaks-good-bad-ugly/\">'Wikileaks: The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly!' </a>\r\n<h1><span style=\"color: #28a026;\">#deltacharlie</span></h1>\r\n<strong>According to a recent report from the FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there is a new warning about an ongoing, eight-year-long North Korean state-sponsored hacking operation 'Hidden Cobra 'by the malicious hacking group, the Lazarus Group. </strong>\r\n\r\nThe group is strongly suspected to have a malware variant 'DeltaCharlie' which could infect hundreds of thousands of computers globally as part of its DDoS botnet network as part of 'Hidden Cobra', the report warns. And that's not the worse part, 'Lazarus Group' also known as 'Guardians of Peace,' is believed to be backed by the North Korean government and are known to launch cyber attacks against global institutions, including media organizations, aerospace and financial sectors, and critical infrastructure. They have previously been involved with the 2013 DarkSeoul operation, the devastating 2014 Sony Pictures Hack, and may have been involved in WannaCry.\r\n\r\nIn the new report, the agencies identified IP addresses with \"high confidence\" associated with 'DeltaCharlie,' which can launch a variety of DDoS attacks on its targets, including Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, Network Time Protocol (NTP) attacks, and Character Generation Protocol (CGP) attacks. \"The botnet malware is capable of downloading executables on the infected systems, updating its own binaries, changing its own configuration in real-time, terminating its processes, and activating and terminating DDoS attacks.\" Somewhat surprisingly, it is not new. 'DeltaCharlie' was initially reported by Novetta in their 2016 Operation Blockbuster Malware Report. However, researchers at Kaspersky Lab, recently detected one 'Hidden Cobra' malware sample contained a hard-coded IP that belongs to a major U.S. financial institution.\r\n\r\nThe DHS and FBI recommend that network administrators review the IP addresses, file hashes, network signatures, and YARA rules provided, and add the IPs to their watchlist to determine if the malicious activity has occurred on their network.\r\n<div id=\"___gcse_2\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"___gcse_2\"></div>\r\n<blockquote>If users or administrators detect the custom tools indicative of HIDDEN COBRA, these tools should be immediately flagged, reported to the DHS National Cybersecurity Communications and Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and given highest priority for enhanced mitigation. -official alert statement</blockquote>\r\nTo learn more about the Lazarus Group, read this previous issue of <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/2017-05-19-unm4sk3d-cyber-security-news/\">UNM4SK3D. </a>\r\n<h1 class=\"\"><span style=\"color: #28a026;\">#malware</span></h1>\r\n<strong>Security researchers have discovered the culprit behind cyber attacks on the Ukrainian industrial control systems in December 2015, and this discovery has other countries worried over what could happen if the malware puts 'lights out' again. </strong>\r\n\r\nThe power outage in the northern part of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, leading to a blackout for tens of thousands of citizens is believed to be caused by a dangerous piece of malware in the wild that targets critical industrial control systems. Discovered by Slovakia-based security software maker ESET and US critical infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc., this malware, dubbed 'Industroyer' or 'CrashOverRide,' is the biggest threat designed to disrupt industrial control systems since Stuxnet. You may remember Stuxnet as \"the first malware allegedly developed by the US and Israel to sabotage the Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009.\" Unlike Stuxnet, 'CrashOverRide' relies on four industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems.\r\n\r\n'CrashOverRide' can control electricity substation switches and circuit breakers, allowing an attacker to simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and causing more severe damage to equipment, partially because these systems were designed so long ago. In the opinion of Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee, \"the 'CrashOverRide' malware is capable of causing power outages that can last up to a few days in portions of a country's electric grid, but it is not capable enough to bring down the entire grid of a nation.\" Further, \"'CrashOverRide' is not unique to any particular vendor or configuration and instead leverages knowledge of grid operations and network communications to cause impact; in that way, it can be immediately re-purposed in Europe and portions of the Middle East and Asia.\" Likewise, the malware can be modified to target other types of critical infrastructure, like transportation, gas lines, or water facilities, as well with additional protocol modules.\r\n<blockquote>The malware contains a few more features that are designed to enable it to remain under the radar, to ensure the malware's persistence, and to wipe all traces of itself after it has done its job. -ESET researchers</blockquote>\r\nDespite the danger of this new malware, there are still best practices.

Your boss has given you a USB flash drive which was recovered from a suspect's home. He is suspected to be a fraud who is involved in credit card scams.\r\n\r\nInside the USB is the following files (which you must set-up):\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Let's download an image and rename it: <strong>BlvckAr7.jpg</strong>.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>This is a basic image, within this we'll place a secret file i.e. use stenography, which we'll come to a little later.</li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94456\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"281\"]<img class=\"wp-image-94456 size-full\" src=\"https://www.cybrary.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/post-161-0-19506600-1445609356.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"179\" /> Right click image, then select \"save as\" or \"save image as\" to save this file to your computer.[/caption]</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li> A zip file, which appears to be password protected... We'll come to this later.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>~$ The_setup_1</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Kali Linux OS (on any environment)</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>If you do not have a Kali box, there are plenty of tutorials out there which go through, a step-by-step process in order to install and configure it properly. NOTE, it would be worthless installing and configuring a Kali machine SPECIFICALLY for this article. However, I would suggest it if you're interested in hacking and forensics in general. I'll leave links towards the end of this article for tutorials and guides on the installation process.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>A USB flash drive</strong><strong> (to set the scene, this isn't a necessity though)</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAssuming you have these two requirements, let's move on to the next stage.\r\n\r\n<strong>~$ The_setup_2</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>sudo apt-get upgrade (if your machine requires upgrading)</strong></li>\r\n \t<li><strong>sudo apt-get install steghide</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow that we have the tool required, let's create our secret file.\r\n\r\nYou can use any text editor. Name this file <strong>S3CR37Z.txt</strong>, and the layout should look something like this:\r\n\r\n<strong>FORENAME SURNAME:    ACCOUNT NUMBER</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>TYPE:                                          VISA</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>EXPIRATION:                         DATE</strong>\r\n\r\nCreate multiple entries, and try to make it seem as real as possible.\r\n\r\nOnce you've completed this task, let's hide this file into the image file we downloaded earlier. In order to do this, we use steghide. On the terminal enter the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>steghide embed -cf BlvckAr7.jpg -ef S3CR37Z.txt</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Next, it will ask you for a password. For this, we will use qwerty123 (Of course this is significantly insecure, however, the criminal assumes nobody would know that the file is hidden inside of the image).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Once we have completed this successfully we can delete S3CR37Z.txt</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Type in <strong>rm S3CR37Z.txt</strong> (to remove the text file with the secret contents).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSubsequently we create a zip file which is named <strong>cats.zip. </strong>This zip will also be password protected and contain the image <strong>BlvckAr7.jpg</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>zip -e cats.zip BlvckAr7.jpg</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Again, it will ask you for a password, which we will set as <strong>scarface23</strong> (this password is more secure than the last, however is it really strong?)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n--- At this point you should have a zip file named <em>cats.zip</em>, inside of this zip, is an image, within the image is a secret file, which we have no access to ---\r\n\r\nIf you've reached this point, great! Now it's time to store this zipfile into a USB, which is the hypothetical USB we've recovered from the crime scene. So place the content inside of it and let's begin with the forensics!\r\n\r\n<strong>~$ Setting_the_scene  --Forensic_Analyst</strong>\r\n\r\nOkay so, we receive a USB stick, the first thing we should do as a forensic analyst is to create a bit-by-bit image of it, and verify the integrity of it, however before we proceed with this, we should create a folder called 'Secure_Store'.\r\n\r\nWithin this, we will have a few more folders.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>mkdir Secure_Store</li>\r\n \t<li>cd Secure_Store; mkdir image logical physical analysis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor this assignment we will be using image, physical and analysis.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Image will contain the bit-by-bit copied image</li>\r\n \t<li>physical will contain the contents of the USB</li>\r\n \t<li>and analysis will have our analysis of the USB, i.e. our findings.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnce we have created these directories we must unmount the flash drive from the main file system, so that we could image it, and mount it within our Secure evidence directory (Secure_Store)\r\n\r\nWe do this by entering:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>df -hl</strong> (this will list the drives withing your machine)\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>You should look for the flash drive, if you're finding difficulties in doing so, you could unplug it, run the same command and find the differences between the result.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFilesystem           size           used           avail           use%               mounted on\r\n\r\nThe above should be the columns that the command returns, once we have identified the USB drive, locate where it is mounted.\r\n\r\nFrom this we should note the filesystem entry of the USB and the mounted on entry.\r\n\r\nIt may look something like: /media/root/Name_of_USB in the mount entry column. (This would differ depending on your user name, USB name etc.)\r\n\r\nSo we can copy that row (/media/root/Name_of_USB)\r\n\r\nNext, type in the following command to remove it from the main filesystem:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>umount /media/root/Name_of_USB</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>now type the df command again to see if it has been removed from the list.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext we create a bit-by-bit image by using the name of the USB filesystem. We could use dd, or dd_secure, either one would be an excellent choice. This may take a while, so be patient.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>dd if=/dev/sdb1   of=~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.dd</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Where it says /dev/sdb1 on this example, you may need to change it depending on the results from the output of your df -lh command.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>***NOTE BE VERY CAUTIOUS***</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOnce this task is complete, we can verify the bit-by-bit copy by using the md5 hashing algorithm.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>md5sum /dev/sdb1</strong></li>\r\n \t<li><strong>mdf5sum ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.dd</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>if these provide the exact same result, we're good to go!</li>\r\n \t<li>It may be best to note these down, or store them in a text file, for the final report (We won't be going over the report as part of this article)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSubsequently we can mount the USB inside of the Secure_Store/physical directory\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>mount ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/image/USB_image.dd ~/Desktop/Secure_Store/physical</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNow if we go into the physical directory we should see a zip file named cats.zip... <strong>copy it to the analysis directory, begin working inside of the analysis</strong> <strong>directory</strong>. Now we can see, it has a password? How do we get around this?\r\n\r\nLet's create a small password cracking script with python. The password file we will use is called rockyou.txt. This file could be found online, it contains millions of real-user passwords, which were found on vulnerable website databases.\r\n\r\nGo to this website, <a href=\"https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords\">https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords</a>, and click on rockyou.txt.bz2, give it some time to download.\r\n\r\nOnce we have it downloaded, extract the file into your Desktop.\r\n\r\nNow let's make the script.\r\n\r\nThis script will loop through every line within the rockyou.txt file, attempting to extract the files from the cats.zip folder passing the line as a password.\r\n\r\nOpen a text editor, we'll just use gedit, enter <strong>gedit zipCracker.py</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>###############################################</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>#  Created by Aslam Admani for Cybrary WannaCrack blog #</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>###############################################</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>import zipfile</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>def Main()</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>    f = open('~/Desktop/rockyou.txt', 'r') #open the rockyou.txt file in read mode</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>    for line in f.readlines(): #iterate through each line of the password file</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>         pw = line.strip('n') #remove default newline keys at the end of each password</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>         try:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>             zfile = zipfile.ZipFile('/root/Desktop/Secure_Store/physical/cats.zip') #declare the zip file you want to use, the path I'm using is /root/Desktop/ Because I'm using the root user, find the current working directory in which your zip file lies.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>             zfile.extractall(/root/Desktop/Secure_Store/physical ,pwd=pw) #attempt to extract all from the zip file, with the current password</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>             print 'password found: %s' % pw  #if this works, print the password to the screen</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>        except:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>             pass #otherwise pass until we have our password</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>if __name__ == '__main__':</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>    Main()</strong>\r\n\r\nThe python script looks good, run it in the terminal:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>python zipCracker.py</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis may take a while depending on how deep the passwords we made are within the rockyou.txt file.\r\n\r\nIf this has run successfully, which it should, your next objective is to analyse the image we see...\r\n\r\n<img class=\"\" src=\"http://content.invisioncic.com/Mflaregames/monthly_10_2015/post-161-0-19506600-1445609356.jpeg\" width=\"458\" height=\"292\" />\r\n\r\nWe have an image named <strong>BlvckAr7.jpg</strong>, it appears to look like a normal jpeg file. However the eyes can deceive, we must dig further.\r\n\r\nLet's start, using <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>EXIFTOOL</strong></span>.\r\n\r\nExiftool is an analysis tool, which can analyse many file extensions, find original extensions plus more.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>exiftool BlvckAr7.jpg</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>if this command doesn't work, use sudo apt-get install exiftool to install it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWith this jpg file we shouldn't see anything particularly suspicious?\r\n\r\nHowever let's put our forensics caps on and think outside the box, we have an image which states 'nothing to see here', let's google this and see if we have the same image, with the same extension, if so, we could download all similar files and compare the sizes. Maybe that could give us a lead?\r\n\r\nSo we download the exact same images we find, and we compare the sizes, using exiftool, notice the difference? One is bigger than the other right?\r\n\r\nLet's check the integrity of both files, using md5sum,\r\n\r\nWe can see there's a difference. Maybe it could be that this image was taken from another source, or something of the sort, regardless we have our suspicions. Let's assume there's another file inside of the S3CR37Z.jpg file, so let's now use steghide to extract what we may have in there.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>steghide extract -sf BlvckAr7.jpg</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>it's asking us for a passphrase, what do we do here!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLet's create a python file called StegCrack.py\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>##############################################</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong># Created by Aslam Admani for Cybrary WannaCrack blog#</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>##############################################</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>import pexpect</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>import os</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>def Main():</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>    PROMPT = ['$ ',  '# ', '&gt; ', '&gt;&gt; ']</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>    f=open('~/Desktop/rockyou.txt', 'r')</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>    for line in f.readlines():</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>        pw = line.strip('n')</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>        try:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>            child = pexpect.spawn('steghide extract -sf S3CR37Z.jpg')</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>            child.expect([pexpect.TIMEOUT, 'passphrase: ', 'Passphrase: ', 'password: '])</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>            child.sendline(pw)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>             child.expect(PROMPT)</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>         except:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>             pass</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>if __name__ == '__main__':</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>    Main()</strong>\r\n\r\nThis should release the hidden file into the current directory, and now we should see a file called: <strong>S3CR37Z.txt</strong>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this script doesn't display the password to the output, however you can check out my github to see if there are any updates to these scripts. <a href=\"https://github.com/c0d14k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/c0d14k</a>\r\n\r\nIf you're interested or need help, here's a video to show how to download and install Kali Linux on VMWare Player: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5mNnkG0FVk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5mNnkG0FVk</a>\r\n\r\n<em>Congratulations if you have completed this article, followed along and were sucessful!</em>\r\n\r\nComments and tips would be highly appreciated.",

Of those individuals, it seems a large number come to the exam with plenty of experience and assume they can get by on that alone. And while experience can certainly help, it's often the testing structure, questions, or wide range of material that can trip up even the most seasoned professional. That's where the Network+ practice test can help.\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking that someone who has experience but can't pass may not be good at their job, or was lazy with their studies, but think back to high school taking the SATs. There are very few individuals who can sit an exam based on what they believe they know and pass with flying colors. Becoming a good test taker requires diligence and preparation for most.\r\n<h3><strong>Confidence is Key</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>Today I sat for and passed the N10-006 Network+ exam. It was my first time sitting for the exam.\r\n\r\nIt was a tough exam in light of how broad the content coverage is. I just made it (by percentage I passed by about 3-4 questions, like an 84%). There was material on the exam that I had never even heard of considering my preparation. But, as you can see, I passed. So it’s possible if you put the time and effort in. And, some of you may likely have it far easier given your experience (I have zero).\r\n\r\nThe Network+ exam doesn't get you on depth of material but on breadth of material. People with a lot of hands- on experience in the support sense may not have security knowledge. People with LAN experience may not have any WAN experience or infrastructure experience. My point is that it all requires study and the exam doesn't measure experience in every area but requires the candidate to gain knowledge to pass the exam.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>John Mulligan, Network Administrator</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nNot every test is directly tied to your experience, a fact which may help or hinder you. That means professionals at all levels will need to do preparation work to fill in any gaps in their knowledge.\r\n\r\nDon’t let this fact frustrate or disheartened you, rather, use it as an opportunity to strengthen your all-around know. Practice tests can be particularly useful in this respect.\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Practice Test?</strong></h3>\r\nWith the Network+ practice test, you gain 6-month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the test, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.  This Practice Test has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs. Select items by test objective, set study preferences and control how your answers are accessed.</li>\r\n \t<li>Select preset tests. These tests are made to provide a testing experience similar to a real testing environment. They are timed and filter questions like the certification exam. This option will help you determine your readiness for the certification exam.</li>\r\n \t<li>Flashcard review allows you to review concepts in a self-graded and unlimited environment. With hundreds of questions, these premade flashcards will help you understand concepts covered on the actual certification exam.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><strong>How Will it Help Me Pass?</strong></h3>\r\nIf used correctly, the Network+ practice test will help you pass because it will ultimately give you a simulated exam in the same format with the same timing as a real exam. Often, we’re not used to taking an exam in this manner, so it helps us feel comfortable that the material, not the environment, is the focus. It all goes back to confidence.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you get feedback specific to topic areas that need improvement so you can spend time reviewing what you don’t know rather than wasting time going over all the content.\r\n\r\nWe recommend first going through the exam in assessment mode (option 2, as listed above) to see what you know and don’t know going into the exam. Then, use options 1 and 3 to hone in on specific topics that need improvement. Lastly, go through option 2 as many times as needed until you feel comfortable going into the real test.\r\n<h3><strong>Transcender Network+ Practice Test Reviews</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>I found the Transcender Exams to be fantastic! The questions were more intense than the actual Network+ exam, and I felt were a tremendous learning tool. It has become a common practice for the training staff at our company to recommend your products. Thanks!\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>M.M.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI recently ordered the practice exams for the Network+ N10-006 test. I placed the order on Sunday October 5 and it arrived at my house within a few days. I had already scheduled the certification test to be taken on October 27. The test was a success! This was my first certification test that I have taken. Your product, without a doubt, was the best study material that I came across! I'm excited to get ready for the Security+ test. Without question, I will be ordering the Transcender practice tests for this exam. Keep up the good work\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>J.P.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<em>*Note: These are real testimonials taken from the Transcender website.

        "post_content": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-94297\" src=\"https://www.cybrary.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nonprofit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" />Of course, cyber security is important for all organizations, but sometimes, best practices are easier to implement for some companies than others, especially nonprofits. Operating with typically a smaller budget and a smaller staff, the costs and manpower needed to implement a strong data protection program can put a strain on a nonprofit, leaving the company open to vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nStill, nonprofits store a ton of sensitive data including donor information, credit card information and staff employment and health insurance records, which need protection. For many in management roles at these organizations, it’s hard to make guarding against an invisible threat a priority when you’re already focused on helping others.\r\n\r\nIt’s important for nonprofits not to fall for any of the <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/avoiding-fraud/\">typical myths surrounding their data security</a>, most specifically the myth that only ‘large’ nonprofits get hacked.  This is absolutely false. Hacker mentality shows that hackers will hack any system.\r\n\r\nAccording to CohnReznick’s most recent Not-for-Profit Governance Survey,\r\n<blockquote>71% of not-for-profits surveyed have not conducted a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment to evaluate their technology exposure. In addition, 69% do not have a cybersecurity breach response plan in place.</blockquote>\r\n<h3><strong>What is SIEM as a Service and How Can It Help?</strong></h3>\r\nSecurity information and event management solutions delivered as a service “combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). It provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.”\r\n\r\nThat means, relevant security data about an enterprise’s security is available in multiple locations and allows you to look at all the data from one point of view, making it easier to spot trends and see patterns that are out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nIn this model, the entire platform and infrastructure are outsourced to a service provider, meaning the customer (in this case the nonprofit) is only responsible for the content development within the SIEM application and the actual use of the data.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the costs of SIEM setup, such as licensing, installation and usually Professional Services consultancy are also moved towards the Service Provider, especially beneficial for an organization that wants predictable expenses or for those who do not have an extensive budget to justify the cost of setting up and SIEM environment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most importantly, this model puts the development responsibility on the Service Provider, wherein they must maintain a team of developers, architects, and systems administrators to keep the platform operational and to make necessary changes.\r\n<h3><strong>I Want SIEM for My Organization, How Can I Get It?</strong></h3>\r\nSIEM as a service is just one of many services offered by the revolutionary company, ‘Invinsec’ who provide rapid capability to organizations who face cyber-threats with little or no security capacity of their own; and we augment the capabilities of organizations who do have a security team.\r\n\r\nInvinsec was formed by two members of the UK and Ireland senior leadership team from a Big 4 Cybersecurity practice. Inspired by the belief that businesses deserve world-class security at affordable prices, they set about building a company that has grown rapidly and delivered excellent service to their growing client list. Invinsec is focused on the private and not-for-profit sectors.\r\n\r\nAmong their 3 service packages offered, from BroadBot to BroadBot premium, they include SIEM as a service as a feature. To learn more, visit their <a href=\"https://www.invinsec.com/\">website.</a>\r\n<h3><strong>Secure All Companies</strong></h3>\r\nAt Cybrary, we’re dedicated to teaching cyber security to anyone, anywhere who wants the opportunity to learn. We believe in addition services like those offered by Invinsec, a critical defense against security breaches starts with training individuals on best practices.\r\n\r\nIf you are a nonprofit looking to start or train a security team, we encourage you to check out the<a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/teams/?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=SIEM\"> Cybrary Teams</a> platform. There, you can request a demo or speak to someone from our sales team who will help craft the right solution for your organization.\r\n<div class=\"postArticle-content js-postField js-notesSource js-trackedPost\" data-post-id=\"6c363e797fff\" data-source=\"post_page\" data-collection-id=\"33024b0003d8\" data-tracking-context=\"postPage\" data-scroll=\"native\"><section class=\"section section--body section--first section--last\">\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<figure id=\"97fb\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\" data-scroll=\"native\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*TJdKYCTCfie03veg.png\" data-width=\"235\" data-height=\"300\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignleft\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*TJdKYCTCfie03veg.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"230\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*TJdKYCTCfie03veg.png\" /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/members/olynch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/members/olynch/\">Olivia Lynch</a> </strong><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">(@Cybrary_Olivia) </strong>is the Marketing Manager at Cybrary.

The victim was Dyn, a company that provides DNS service. Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) caused the outage, and up to 100,000 malicious endpoints were used for the attack. The malicious “endpoints” were IoT devices – digital cameras and DVR players that were connected to the internet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What made the attack so easy to execute was the 1) availability of IoT devices with default username and passwords (some were hard coded) which could easily be compromised and 2) availability of DDOS tools. Yet the attack was not as easy to try to prevent because of the massive scale of the attack. Brian Krebs mentions in a recent post about the availability of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/06/following-the-money-hobbled-vdos-attack-for-hire-service/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VDOS for hire</a>, which is “virtual hired muscle that can be rented to knock nearly any website offline.”</p>\r\nHow could this have been prevented? What can we do in the future? The standard guidelines for defense against DDOS include:\r\n\r\n-<span style=\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\">          </span>disabling unnecessary services\r\n\r\n-<span style=\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\">          </span>using anti-malware\r\n\r\n-<span style=\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\">          </span>enabling router throttling\r\n\r\n-<span style=\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\">          </span>using a reverse proxy\r\n\r\n-<span style=\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\">          </span>enabling ingress and egress filtering\r\n\r\n-<span style=\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\">          </span>degrading services and\r\n\r\n-<span style=\"font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';\">          </span>absorbing the attack\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The cryptographer, Adi Shamir, suggests; “The government should definitely do something about it - they should not allow devices which are not sufficiently secure to be connected to the public internet.” Bold statement but very true. Security is not something built into many IoT devices since that's not what they are \"designed for.\" I mean logically speaking, why would a refrigerator need security measures built in? Well, if it has an internet connection, why <em>shouldn't</em> it?</p>\r\nQuestion: How do you prevent this? What’s to stop me from connecting <i>anything</i> to the internet?\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we need better quality control. Period. Any device with hardcoded credentials should not be allowed into the market. That should solve 50% of the problem. The other half can be addressed by user awareness, better software, regular device updates. If my Android phone can be connected securely to the internet, so can my camera or DVR.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts or plans for improvement? Comment below, please.",

Typically, Cybrarians use a variety of resources to ensure they’ve covered all material and experienced a variety of question types. We’d like to offer another resource to add to that list: The Security+ Practice Test.\r\n<h3><strong>Confidence is Key</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>Today I passed the CompTIA Security+ exam - and I was quite surprised. I studied for two weeks using a myriad of sources, because of my ADHD I couldn't consistently stay in-tune with one series…\r\n\r\nI was given 72 questions, and the first couple were simulations. Honestly, I was very intimidated by the fact that simulations were going to be on the exam... but I'm not sure if it was mere luck but the simulations I received were by a LARGE, COMFORTABLE margin easier than the scenario based ‘word problems’...\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire duration of the exam I felt like I was going to fail. A lot of the questioning was extremely different than any material I've ever encountered, which I guess is CompTIA's goal. But not only is the wording and questioning different, I noticed some of the jargon is different as well. In the end, despite being confident in the notion I was going to score somewhere in the 600s, I ended the exam with a solid 804.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Adam Smith, Security Analyst</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nSometimes, the format of questions will catch you off guard and you may not be prepared for questions you assumed would be easier than others, that’s why test preparation is so important. It’s also good to get a handle on the terminology that you will encounter when testing.  A practice test is especially useful in these cases.\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Practice Test?</strong></h3>\r\nWith the Security+ practice test, you gain 6 month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the test, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.  This Practice Test has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs. Select items by test objective, set study preferences and control how your answers are accessed.</li>\r\n \t<li>Select preset tests. These tests are made to provide a testing experience similar to a real testing environment. They are timed and filter questions like the certification exam. This option will help you determine your readiness for the certification exam.</li>\r\n \t<li>Flashcard review allows you to review concepts in a self-graded and unlimited environment. With hundreds of questions, these premade flashcards will help you understand concepts covered on the actual certification exam.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><strong>How Will it Help Me Pass?</strong></h3>\r\nIf used correctly, the Security+ practice test will help you pass because it will ultimately give you a simulated exam in the same format with the same timing as a real exam. Often, we’re not used to taking an exam in this manner, so it helps us feel comfortable that the material, not the environment, is the focus. It all goes back to confidence.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you get feedback specific to topic areas that need improvement so you can spend time reviewing what you don’t know rather than wasting time going over all the content.\r\n\r\nWe recommend first going through the exam in assessment mode (option 2, as listed above) to see what you know and don’t know going into the exam. Then, use options 1 and 3 to hone in on specific topics that need improvement. Lastly, go through option 2 as many times as needed until you feel comfortable going into the real test.\r\n<h3><strong>Transcender Security+ Practice Test Reviews</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>Hello Transcender: I have personally purchased the exams for every one of my tests and they are just great. They prepare you the CompTIA way. I have taken classroom instruction as part of my curriculum and I even use these tests to study for my classes instead of the textbooks. I have found many mistakes in textbooks but not on your exams. Keep up the good work and THANK YOU.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>A.F.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI just passed my Security+ exam.

This document alleged that the <b>Russian General Main Staff Intelligence Directorate</b> (GRU), had attempted to break into a company that sells voting registration equipment prior to the 2016 US presidential election.</strong>\r\n\r\nAlthough the document does not disclose whether the hack had any impact on the outcome of the election, this leak is the latest in bad publicity for the NSA. In the Intercept report on June 5th, it claims in August 2016, Russia's military intelligence agency \"executed a cyber attack on at least one U.S. voting software supplier and sent spear-phishing emails to more than 100 local election officials days before [the] election,\" as disclosed by an 'anonymous' source, who strangely enough had already been taken into custody. Yes, Winner, who held a top-secret security clearance and worked as a government contractor in Georgia with Pluribus International, when confronted about the incident confessed immediately and was arrested before the article was even published. You may recall the Intercept as the site that has been publishing NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden since 2014, whom Winner had 'retweeted' prior to the incident.\r\n\r\nHow was Winner caught so quickly? Well, The Intercept contacted the NSA on May 30 and turned over a copy of the report to verify the authenticity of that document prior to publication. As it turns out, Winner emailed a printed and scanned copy of it to the publication, rather than emailing the PDF directly. According to security experts, newer printers print nearly invisible yellow dots that track down exactly when and where any document is printed. That allowed the FBI to discover that the document was from a printer with model number 54, serial number 29535218. The document was printed on May 9, 2017, at 6:20 and according to NSA record, they can tell who used the printer at that time. The FBI also found that Winner 'had email contact' with The Intercept. She is facing a count of 'gathering, transmitting or losing defense information,' and may get up to 10 years behind bars if she is convicted.\r\n<blockquote>Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors … executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions. … The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to … launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations. -NSA document</blockquote>\r\nLet's explore some of the issues more thoroughly.

That's what happened to those who invested in Bitcoin mining services from companies 'GAW Miners' and 'ZenMiner.' Now, con man Homero Joshua Garza is paying the price after losing his case to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to the SEC, Garza used the \"lure of quick riches\" in order to get about 10,000 people to invest in the bitcoin mining scheme, earning him about $20 million. Bitcoin mining was originally used as a simple way to secure the virtual currency before the idea became popular. You need computational power to solve complex equations, and when these have been solved, you are awarded units of the virtual currency. Homero Joshua Garza offered shares to investors in the companies' Bitcoin mining operation but did not own enough computing power for the mining promised. Instead, he used cash from new investors to reward earlier joiners, which is nothing but a fraudulent \"ponzi\" scheme, as described by the SEC.\r\n\r\nIn the June 2nd ruling, the US District of Connecticut federal court sided with SEC and agreed to order that both GAW Miners and ZenMiner pay $10,384,099 jointly in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, as well as $1,000,000 fees in damages. Since then, GAW Miners and ZenMiner companies have now been shut down, but the case against Garza is ongoing.  Keep in mind that the price of Bitcoin today is about $2,904 per coin. In 2014, when Garza began running the bogus schemes from his home in Connecticut, 1 BTC was equal to $450, meaning the $20 Million funds Garza took from the investors today worth around $150 million. A point that the Register has pointed out, saying \"there would have been more than enough to keep the investors happy and have millions of dollars still left in the bank.\" Looks like Bitcoin bit back. Ouch.\r\n<blockquote>Most investors paid for a share of computing power that never existed -the SEC</blockquote>\r\nYou've heard of mining, but what about blocking?

According to Carpenter's lawyer, the prosecutor did not seek warrants based on probable cause, rather, they requested the records under the Stored Communications Act, which has a lower standard and allows phone companies to disclose records when the government shows “specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe” that records at issue “are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\" While the records do not reveal Carpenter's conversations, they do detail a five-month span in 2010 and 2011, when his cellphone connected with cell towers in the vicinity of the robberies. The court argued that Carpenter had no reason to believe that his cellphone records would be kept private, given that the records simply show where his phone connected with cell towers, without giving away any information about call content.\r\n\r\nA US court had ruled that police could access phone location data without a warrant, but lower courts in many states, including Montana, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, have ruled the opposite. Their rulings indicate phone records are constitutionally protected. This is not the only cellphone related law that is under debate. In two similar cases in Florida, one defendant was sentenced to six months jail for allegedly refusing to reveal his iPhone passcode, while a second defendant walked free after he claimed he forgot his passcode. The United States Court ruled that police can force defendants to decrypt their electronic devices, as long as it does not violate the Fifth Amendment right that prevents any citizen from having to incriminate themselves. However, it appears US judges have different opinions on how to punish those who do not compel the order to unlock their phones. This could mean yet another decision for the Supreme Court in the future.\r\n<blockquote>Because cellphone location records can reveal countless private details of our lives, police should only be able to access them by getting a warrant based on probable cause. The time has come for the Supreme Court to make clear that the long-standing protections of the Fourth Amendment apply with undiminished force to these kinds of sensitive digital records. -Nathan Freed Wessler, an American Civil Liberties Union</blockquote>\r\nWant more on the law's perspective?

For those serious about taking the CISSP exam, you’ll want to ensure you pass on the first try. This post will offer guidance and reviews, as well as a tool to help you be successful in earning your certification: The CISSP practice exam.\r\n\r\nWe’ve seen a lot of chatter on forums surrounding useful study tools, and want to offer some advice.\r\n<h3><strong>Confidence is Key</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>Although I suspected that I was doing okay on the exam, as I grew more psychologically exhausted doubt started creeping in… BIG TIME. By the time I finished reviewing my flagged questions, I figured I shouldn’t get my hopes up. When I clicked the finish button and didn’t immediately get my score, my heart sank. In the back of my mind I’d already resigned to studying another 8 weeks and then attempting the exam again. But, when I got to the front desk I was handed the paper. PASSED! Woot, Woot!\r\n\r\nIt was almost like taking a few different exams combined into one. Some questions were surprisingly clear with only ONE obviously-correct answer. While other questions seemed to be from a completely different exam, where the questions were far less clear with three out of four answers might be correct. Many were the “think like a C-Level” type that I had read about, while other questions obviously wanted you to think like a technician… Luckily it was pretty apparent which role you were expected to play on a particular question, at least to me.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I want to mention, although it could have been just my perception shifting as I became more and more mentally fatigued, but the questions seemed to get a little harder as the test progressed. I swear the first 100 questions seemed like something you might see on the Security+ exam, but later in the exam things seemed to get much more difficult. Trick of the mind? I don’t know, but I wanted to mention it.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>brchap, Cybrary member</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nFor the full review of this exam and the study materials used to pass, read the full post <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/forums/topic/passed-the-cissp-exam-jan-19-2016-long-post-lots-of-links/\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nIt seems however, the most important takeaway speaks to the design of the exam. The CISSP is an extensive test, obviously meant to strain the test taker and push beyond a simple question and answer scenario.\r\n\r\nEntering the test with confidence after having prepared to the best of your abilities is the best way to approach such a rigorous exam. Don’t let a test get inside your head. You know what you’ve prepared for and what you have not. That’s why a practice exam is so valuable.\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Practice Exam?</strong></h3>\r\nWith the CISSP practice exam, you gain 6 month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the exam, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.  This Practice Exam has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice exam to suit your specific study needs. Select items by test objective, set study preferences and control how your answers are accessed.</li>\r\n \t<li>Select preset exams. These exams are made to provide a testing experience similar to a real testing environment. They are timed and filter questions like the certification exam. This option will help you determine your readiness for the certification exam.</li>\r\n \t<li>Flashcard review allows you to review concepts in a self-graded and unlimited environment. With hundreds of questions, these premade flashcards will help you understand concepts covered on the actual certification exam.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><strong>How Will it Help Me Pass?</strong></h3>\r\nIf used correctly, the CISSP practice exam will help you pass because it will ultimately give you a simulated exam in the same format with the same timing as a real exam. Often, we’re not used to taking an exam in this manner, so it helps us feel comfortable that the material, not the environment, is the focus. It all goes back to confidence.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you get feedback specific to topic areas that need improvement so you can spend time reviewing what you don’t know rather than wasting time going over all the content.\r\n\r\nWe recommend first going through the exam in assessment mode (option 2, as listed above) to see what you know and don’t know going into the exam. Then, use options 1 and 3 to hone in on specific topics that need improvement. Lastly, go through option 2 as many times as needed until you feel comfortable going into the real test.\r\n<h3><strong>Transcender CISSP Practice Exam Reviews</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>[I] Paid 4k for a CISSP Training Boot Camp and it was a waste of money... I stayed in class and listened to nonsensical drivel about stuff I already knew! Mid second day I left and purchased a 30 day Transcender license to CISSP and studied for 4 days and took test as scheduled. I can’t say it was an easy test...but Transcender familiarized me with the basic reasoning to understand what they asked. Gotta say though I will use these to get the paper for a few others that will enhance my stature in today’s IT world. Transcender is tops!!\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>J.S.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTranscender picks up where even the best CISSP books leave off - and then blows them away. I found the exam simulations to be great preparation for the real thing. Your exams covered every concept thoroughly and mimicked the actual test environment perfectly. I also found your answer explanations to be better written than any that I have found in those $50.00 books. When people ask me what I did to pass the test, I tell them, \"I got the Transcender.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>L.C.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<em>*Note: These are real testimonials taken from the Transcender website.

If you’re not familiar with the content of the A+ course or why it may be so popular, I suggest you start by reading<a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/complete-guide-earning-your-a-certification/\"> ‘A Complete Guide to Earning Your A+ Certification.’</a> For those already invested in learning the fundamentals covered by this course and who are interested in getting A+ certified, this blog will offer an overview and some reviews of a helpful tool: The CompTIA A+ Practice Test.\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve decided the A+ certification is the credential you’re going to pursue, most likely your next question is ‘How Do I Pass?’ While there’s not a straightforward answer to the best study techniques for you, there is one thing that’s required for all test takers, and that’s confidence.\r\n\r\nWhether you have the hands-on experience, have been doing an instructor guided course or self-guided study, feel comfortable with the material in a test environment is key. And that doesn’t mean going to a test dump and memorizing all the answers. Because let’s face it, if earning your certification lands you a job, (and we sure hope it does) having memorized test answers isn’t going to help.\r\n\r\nTest anxiety can tend to hit even the most prepared professional, and many will even admit to failing their exam the first time when they shouldn’t have for lack of knowledge.\r\n<h3><strong>Confidence is Key</strong></h3>\r\n<blockquote>One of the biggest issues I dealt with was misplaced confidence. I actually failed the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam the first time I took it.\r\n\r\nNow, this was the first certification exam I had ever taken, but that really didn't have much to do with why I didn't pass. I have been working with computers all of my life so I kind of felt like I could walk in and knock out this exam no problem.\r\n\r\nThe reality was that there is a lot more to this than knowing how to put together and work on a computer, and I had to find this out the hard way… You have to know the origins of certain PC components, not only what they do but how they affect the system as a whole. What is the best hardware or software to use in a certain PC in a certain situation? You need to know the details of why one component is different than the other and what each one would be used for.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Zach Monroe, Technical Support Specialist</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nZach’s story resonates with many because even those who are very familiar with a certain task or topic may have a heard explaining that topic. Don't let the format of an exam disprove your knowledge. Prepare different types of test questions so that you are able to answer in a variety of ways. Not only will this help you pass, but it will also improve the knowledge you retain long-term.\r\n<h3><strong>What is a Practice Test?</strong></h3>\r\nWith the A+ practice test, you gain 6 month access to a world of information that can help you succeed on the exam, including analytics on your strengths and weaknesses.  This Practice Test has a few options available to enhance your learning experience:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Customize your testing experience by configuring your practice test to suit your specific study needs.

Not only did the simulations prepare me for the actual A+ test, but they also significantly strengthened some of my weaker areas by letting me know where I was weak and then providing the appropriate references for further study.

Seeing as many Cybrary users are simply looking to get their start, it’s only logical that I provide an overview for earning perhaps the most popular IT certification, the CompTIA A+ certification.\r\n\r\nThe CompTIA A+ course hones in on the fundamentals of computer technology including repair, basic networking, installation and configuration of PCs, laptops and related hardware and configuration for mobile including Android and Apple.\r\n\r\nFor those ultimately looking for a career in hacking or security, it is important to recognize that unless you are coming in with a thorough IT background, you will need to know the basics covered in the A+ first and work your way from there.\r\n\r\nFuture hackers will most likely want to progress from CompTIA A+, to CompTIA Network+, to CompTIA Security+ before advancing to CSA+ or the CEH, and learn at least one programming language along the way, although there are varying opinions on this.\r\n\r\nSo, for those starting at the beginning, I will provide a guide for earning your CompTIA A+ certification and point towards specific tools which will help you achieve success.\r\n<h3><strong>CompTIA A+ Overview </strong></h3>\r\nThe CompTIA A+ exam is designed to certify the competency of entry-level PC computer service professionals in installing, maintaining, customizing, and operating personal computers. Obtaining the certification validates entry-level IT skills in today’s essential domains and ensures proper communication and customer service skills.\r\n<h4><strong>How Does It Compare? </strong></h4>\r\nIf you don’t believe you’re ready to jump into the A+ exam, CompTIA also offers an <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/practice_labs/comptia-it-fundamentals?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=A%2B%20Blog\">‘IT Fundamentals’ exam</a>, code FC0-U51, which signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to identify and explain computer components, install software, establish network connectivity and prevent security risks. While it covers some similar topics as the A+, this exam is targeted more specifically for “advanced end-users and entry-level IT professionals.”\r\n\r\nA similar certification also meant for beginners with less computer experience is the <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/practice_labs/ic3-digital-literacy-certification-global-standard-5?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=A%2B%20Blog\">IC3 Digital Literacy Global Standard 5</a>. This certification signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to effectively use some of the world’s most current and prominent technologies. The exam is divided into 3 parts: computing fundamentals, living online, and key applications.\r\n<h4><strong>Who Is A+ Intended For?</strong></h4>\r\nThis certification is meant to be the starting point for those looking to break into IT. As a standalone certification, it prepares individuals to fulfill call center, help desk and computer repair type jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen the knowledge from this certification is built upon, it can help individual move forward to learn networking, security, and even hacking. While not recommended for those looking for programming specific careers, general computer knowledge can always be useful.\r\n\r\nAccording to CompTIA “If you’re new to the IT industry, this will help you put your best foot forward. And if you’re already an IT professional, the CompTIA A+ certification validates your skills and can boost your career.”\r\n<h4><strong>Why Should I Earn the A+ Certification? </strong></h4>\r\nThere are a variety of reasons why the A+ certification is a good choice for a credential to achieve. The A+ certification exam demands no prerequisites, introduces candidates to the essential IT domains, and is globally recognized as the mark of a skilled entry-level technician.\r\n\r\nTypically, the A+ certification is a mandatory hiring requirement for a variety of entry-level IT jobs and those who possess this certification are more likely to receive higher salaries. For example, on average, certified professionals make five to 15% more than their non-certified counterparts in the US.\r\n\r\nA+ certification is a requirement or elective in the advanced certification paths of leading technology vendors, including Microsoft, Cisco, Novell, HP, and IBM. Additionally, organizations such as the U.S. Department of Defense, Dell, Intel and Lenovo recognize this entry-level certification as validation that an employee is competent to fulfill the roles of a support tech, service technician and support specialist.\r\n<h4><strong>CompTIA A+ Exam Details </strong></h4>\r\nThe CompTIA A+ exam, as well as the A+ course on Cybrary were updated to reflect new content, designated by the exam codes: 220-901 and 220-902. Individuals must pass both exams in order to earn their certification.\r\n\r\nExam 220-901 covers PC hardware and peripherals, mobile device hardware, networking and troubleshooting hardware and network connectivity issues. Testers must score 675 on a scale of 900 in order to pass.\r\n\r\nExam 220-902 covers installing and configuring operating systems including Windows, iOS, Android, Apple OS X and Linux. It also addresses security, the fundamentals of cloud computing and operational procedures. Testers must score 700 on a scale of 900 in order to pass.\r\n\r\nBoth exams consist of approximately 90 multiple-choice (single and multiple response), drag and drops, and performance based questions which testers have 90 minutes to complete.\r\n<h4><strong>What is the difference between the 800 and 900 series?</strong></h4>\r\nIn general, the 220-901 exam is about 90% similar to the old 220-801 exam, while the 220-902 exam has been updated more thoroughly. Both exams together contain about 25% new content.\r\n\r\nThe two exams are now more distinct and include less overlap. Mostly, there have been a few structural changes and more performance-based questions have been added.\r\n\r\nOne main topic missing from the new exam is Windows 10. The 220-901 exam went from 5 exam domains to 4, with more emphasis on mobile devices (not just laptops) and a heavy emphasis on troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nThe 220-902 exam added a domain, going from 4 to 5, with The Operational Procedures section added on, and the Troubleshooting section has been split into Hardware and Network Troubleshooting on the 220-901 exam and Software Troubleshooting on the 220-902 exam.\r\n<h4><strong>Topics of Emphasis</strong></h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Security</li>\r\n \t<li>Networking</li>\r\n \t<li>Mobile Devices</li>\r\n \t<li>Hardware</li>\r\n \t<li>Troubleshooting</li>\r\n \t<li>Windows Operating Systems</li>\r\n \t<li>Other operating systems and technologies</li>\r\n \t<li>Technical Support</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Additional A+ Information</strong></h4>\r\nThe CompTIA A+ is compliant with ISO 17024 standards and is approved by the U.S. Department of Defense to meet directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements. It is held by over 1 million individuals worldwide.\r\n<h3><strong>How Can A+ Help My Security Career?</strong></h3>\r\nAccording to CompTIA, “Security isn’t just for the security experts. IT professionals at every level need security knowledge and skills. You'll be able to spot security breaches, identify their origins and escalate threats more quickly than technicians who are not A+ certified.”\r\n\r\nThat being said, this certification will offer an introduction to critical security concepts that will be solidified during later stages of security training, such as the Security+, so learning the basics early will only help with your studies at a later point.\r\n<h4><strong>Recommendations from Testers </strong></h4>\r\n“CompTIA certifications buffed up my resume and landed me a great job. Not only did I gain knowledge in the field, I gained confidence and strategies for success in my career.”\r\n\r\n– Tedley Meralus, IT support specialist, GeoGlobal Partners, LLC\r\n\r\n“CompTIA certifications have not only boosted my salary, but have allowed me to progressively advance in my career as an IT professional.”\r\n\r\n– Robert Kosydar, server systems administrator, U.S. Department of Defense\r\n<h3><strong>What Does Cybrary offer in Preparation of the A+ exam?</strong></h3>\r\nCybrary offers a full spectrum of preparation materials in order to ensure you become A+ certified.\r\n\r\nYou can earn your certification in 4 easy steps:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Take the A+ Course</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nLearn by watching the <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/course/comptia-aplus/?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=A%2B%20Blog\">free online videos</a>, which have been updated to reflect the 900 series and include material for both the 220-901 and 220-902 exams.\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n \t<li>Practice with a Virtual Lab</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nExplore critical concepts covered in the<a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/practice_labs/comptia-a-plus?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=A%2B%20Blog\"> 220-902</a> and gain practical experience in a hands-on environment.\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n \t<li>Assess your Skills with the Practice Tests</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nDive in to a simulated testing environment to receive analytics and feedback on your strengths and weaknesses with both the <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/transcender_tests/compcert-a-220901?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=A%2B%20Blog\">200-901</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/transcender_tests/compcert-a-220902?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=A%2B%20Blog\">220-902</a> practice exams.\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n \t<li>Certify Your Skills</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen you’re ready to take the test, purchase discounted exam vouchers for the <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/certification-exam-marketplace/?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=A%2B%20Blog\">220-901</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/certification-exam-marketplace/?utm_source=0P3N&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=A%2B%20Blog\">220-902</a> exams and schedule your tests at your nearest testing center.\r\n<h4><strong>How Do I Renew My A+ Certification? </strong></h4>\r\nYour CompTIA A+ certification is valid for three years from the day of your exam. “You can participate in a number of activities and training programs, including higher certifications, to renew your CompTIA A+ certification.

News reports of hacking and industrial espionage hit the headlines daily and present a serious threat to small and medium sized businesses. On-premise software still presents its own set of security concerns, but be wary of new technologies and vendors who do not have a robust security system in place.\r\n\r\nOngoing Business Concerns: Small and medium sized businesses many times have no option but to outsource certain tasks, such as IT. However, when you outsource IT, you lose control over how your service provider is doing - business-wise - and can open yourself up to various risks.\r\n\r\nAvailability: Employees at small or medium sized businesses work 24/7 and need access to company data 24/7. However, with SaaS and cloud computing, outside issues like internet and power outages are a common problem.\r\n\r\nIf you have any input, please comment below.",

At all locations, your data is always at risk from intentional and unintentional breaches. And remember, deleted data can always be recovered. Your <strong>data on social websites</strong> is always one of the most significant targets of the attackers. Data belonging to your organization can be targeted by your competitors. Unexpectedly, Data errors may occur by <strong>technical device failures</strong>.\r\n\r\nWe definitely need to maintain the security of the data. Now, I will give you some pointers on how you can implement different ways to protect your data.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, secure the local disk data. The important data must be protected by <strong>disk encryption technologies like PGP Desktop and Bit Locker.</strong> Use <strong>Backup utilities</strong> to <em>prevent data loss.</em> Use <strong>disk wiping utilities</strong> for <em>permanent deletion of files. I strongly suggest that you use an anti-virus software to prevent data from modification without your access.</em> I also recommend that you use <strong>360 Total Security for Windows (https://www.360totalsecurity.com)</strong>. Next, secure the <strong>Online Information</strong>. Ensure Web browsers are using <strong>HTTPS instead of HTTP.</strong> <em>Prevent websites from using your personal information like Real Name, Address, Phone Number or any other sensitive information you want to be selective about being seen. And beware of online scams and social engineering. Then, secure the data of your organization.</em>\r\n\r\nDon't use company related information anywhere. Avoid using unknown laptop computers for your work. Use secure email programs for your email accounts. Here, I suggest using <strong>ProtonMail (https://protonmail.com).</strong> <span class=\"st\"><em>ProtonMail</em> is the world's largest secure email service, developed by CERN and MIT scientists. It is open source and protected by Swiss privacy law. </span>Strict policies should be applied for data confidentiality and availability and update your computer servers regularly.\r\n\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\nIf you want more, you can watch my video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbywSTH_xOE\">Data Security</a>:\r\n\r\nJoin my <a href=\"https://hactivism.thinkific.com/\">academy</a> or watch my video:\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbywSTH_xOE?rel=0\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nFor more info visit my <a href=\"http://thegeeq.gq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Official Website #thegeeq</a>\r\n\r\nThanks for Reading!",

Wifi is a short-range wireless transmission technology that can send signals up to hundreds of feet away to support access to the Internet. But what about the security of our data which is easily breached by any attacker through these airwaves. In this article, I mainly concentrate on the hacking of Wifi passwords which is the first step of taking the privacy of our confidential data. In WIFI there are two main devices used as a wireless client and an access point (router) which gives us radio signals to connect to the internet.\r\n\r\nAn attack on a WIFI network can be divided into two classes:\r\n\r\n1. On network access control, data confidentiality and data integrity protection.\r\n\r\n2. On wireless communication network design, deployment, and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThese attacks are performed due to the weaknesses in wireless security protocols, Access Point broadcast message feature or much more. The access point broadcast feature can be performed on a physical access point. But wireless protocol weaknesses are still a very common vulnerability which can easily perform the attacks because these protocols are mainly used for encryption, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of packets or data. There are three main wireless protocols used:\r\n\r\n1. WEP (Wired Equivalency Privacy )+ RC4\r\n\r\n2. WPA(Wi-Fi Protected Access)+TKIP\r\n\r\n3. WPA2(Wi-Fi Protected Access Version 2)+AES\r\n\r\n(WPA and WPA2 are counted as 1 in this list).\r\n\r\n4. OPEN(no password)\r\n\r\nIn WEP, Confidentiality is provided from the encryption of the frame body using RC4 algorithm, Integrity is maintained through the Integrity Check Algorithm (CRC), and Authentication is provided by the use of a shared key that is only known by authorized users on the network.\r\n\r\nWEP WEAKNESSES:\r\n\r\n1. The Size of IV (RC4 Key) is short and reused.\r\n\r\n2. Problem in the RC4 algorithm itself (outdated algorithm).\r\n\r\n3. Easy forging of authentication messages.\r\n\r\n4. WEP does not Prevent forgery of packets due to plain text of IV’s\r\n\r\n5. WEP does not prevent replay attacks. An attacker can simply record and replay packets as desired due to key size is very short.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWPA came with the purpose of solving the problems in the WEP cryptography method, without the user needing to change the hardware. The standard WPA, similar to WEP, specifies two operation manners: WPAPSK (Pre-Shared Key) that is used for small office and home/domestic use, authentication which does not use an authentication server and the data cryptography key can go up to 256 bits. Unlike WEP, this can be any alphanumeric string and is used only to negotiate the initial session with the AP. Because both the client and the AP already possess this key, WPA provides mutual authentication, and the key is never transmitted over the air.  Another one is Enterprise WPA or Commercial. In this, authentication is made by an authentication server 802.1x, generating excellent control and security in the users' traffic on the wireless network. This WPA uses 802.1X+EAP for authentication, but again replaces WEP with the more advanced TKIP encryption. No preshared key is used here, but you will need a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server for data transfer.\r\n\r\nWPA IMPROVEMENTS:\r\n\r\n1. A cryptographic message integrity code, or MIC, called Michael, to defeat forgeries.\r\n\r\n2. A new IV sequencing discipline, to remove replay attacks from the attacker’s arsenal.\r\n\r\n3. A per-packet key mixing function, to de-correlate the public IVs from weak keys.\r\n\r\n4. TKIP (Temporary Key Integrity Protocol) is used for encryption instead of RC4.\r\n\r\nWPA WEAKNESSES:\r\n\r\n1. “Weakness in Passphrase Choice in WPA Interface”, reveal the passphrase by performing a dictionary attack against WPA-PSK networks by capturing the four-way authentication handshake.\r\n\r\n2. TKIP protocol also has the weakness.\r\n\r\nIn WPA2 Encryption is done using AES algorithm, authentication using EAP-TLS protocol and data integrity using CCMP (Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol). In WPA2-PSK , a pre-shared secret is used, much like WEP or WPA. Access points and clients are all manually configured to use the same secret of up to 64 ASCII characters, such as “this_is_our_secret_password\" and WPA2 corporate security is based on 802.1X (the EAP authentication framework including RADIUS server).\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://learntomato.com/wp-content/uploads/network-security-types-settings.jpg\" alt=\"wifi security\" width=\"595\" height=\"382\" />\r\n\r\nThe main problem of WPA as a pairwise solved by divided the type of security to three categories:\r\n\r\n1. The pairwise cipher suite used to encrypt unicast (point-to-point) traffic.\r\n\r\n2. The group cipher suite used to encrypt multicast and broadcast (point-to-multipoint) traffic.\r\n\r\n3. The use of either a pre-shared key (PSK, or “home user” security, using a shared secret) or 802.1X authentication.\r\n\r\nWPA2 WEAKNESSES:\r\n\r\n1. AES-128 bits protocol is breakable, but it takes a lot of time.\r\n\r\n2. Moderate security due to the insider attacks (group transient key is broadcasted to all the clients which means all clients connected to particular AP having same group key).\r\n\r\n3. Stealth mode ARP Poisoning/Spoofing attack is possible.\r\n\r\nWPA2 SOLUTIONS:\r\n\r\n1. Use endpoint security.\r\n\r\n2. Use wireless traffic monitoring using WIPS sensors.\r\n\r\nThere are various tools available today which are used for breaking the WEP, WPA, WPA2 protocols as aireplay-ng .",

        "post_content": "<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-93779\" src=\"https://www.cybrary.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mc11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" />At Cybrary, we’re doing our best to offer career guidance on the latest certifications, such as the PMP.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to make your decision on which courses to take and credentials to obtain more straightforward. With so many certifications available, it’s hard to know where to begin, which are most reputable and what is best for your specific career goals.\r\n\r\nThe answer, as I’ve said, isn’t one size fits all. But, I’m hoping to make it easier to make these critical decisions by compiling information surrounding some of the most popular topics on the site.\r\n\r\nRecently, I’ve discussed <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/security-certifications-csa-vs-ceh/\">CSA+ vs. CEH</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/0p3n/certifications-mcsa-vs-mcse/\">MCSA vs. MCSE</a>, and tried to differentiate between the two. Since these posts have published, we’ve seen an influx of requests regarding the PMP.\r\n\r\nIn this post, I’ll discuss the route to becoming PMP certified, including more entry level certifications, like CAPM and CompTIA Project+.\r\n\r\nAs you may or may not know, the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from PMI is the gold standard of project management credentials. In order to obtain your PMP, there are few things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\nThe prerequisites for taking the PMP exam are a secondary degree (high school diploma, associate’s degree or the global equivalent), 7,500 hours leading and directing projects, and 35 hours of project management education, <strong>or</strong> a four-year degree, 4,500 hours leading and directing projects, and 35 hours of project management education.\r\n<h4><strong>Where Should I Start?</strong></h4>\r\nIf you’re not ready or unable to meet the prerequisites for the PMP at this time, there are two other project management certifications you can take to get started: the Certified Associate In Project Management (CAPM) from PMI or the Project+ from CompTIA.\r\n<h3><strong>Why Earn a Project Management Certification?</strong></h3>\r\nThrough 2020, 1.57 million new jobs will be created each year and among those, qualified management practitioners are in high demand. Whether you have a technical background or work in an enterprise environment and are looking to assume a leadership role, management is a skill every professional needs.\r\n\r\nAmong survey respondents to PMI’s Earning Power Salary Survey, those with a PMP certification garner a higher salary (20% higher on average) than those without a PMP certification.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, CompTIA reports “Project Management is fourth in specialized skills in IT job postings. It is also the third hottest in demand tech skill with 39% of respondents with hiring plans said they will be seeking people with this skill in the next 12 months.”\r\n<h3><strong>PMI CAPM Overview </strong></h3>\r\nDesigned for those with less project experience, the CAPM is intended to demonstrate candidates' understanding of the fundamental knowledge, terminology and processes of effective project management.\r\n\r\nAccording to PMI, “If you’d like to manage larger projects and gain more responsibility or add project management skills into your current role, then the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) is right for you.”\r\n<h4><strong>What are the Prerequisites? </strong></h4>\r\nSimilar to the PMP, PMI has implemented fairly strict requirement before one can sit for the certification exam. The prerequisites for taking the CAPM exam are a secondary degree (high school diploma, associate’s degree or the global equivalent) <strong>and</strong> 1,500 hours of project experience<strong> or </strong>23 hours of project management education completed by the time you sit for the exam.\r\n<h4><strong>CAPM Exam Details</strong></h4>\r\nThe certification exam has 150 multiple choice questions which testers have three hours to complete.\r\n<h4><strong>What Does Earning the CAPM Mean?</strong></h4>\r\nObtaining your certification signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to manage all aspects of any project, regardless of scope, budget and time constraints.\r\n<h4><strong>What Tools Does Cybrary Offer In Preparation for the CAPM? </strong></h4>\r\nCybrary offers a <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/course/practical-project-management/\">‘Practical Project Management Course’</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/transcender_tests/pmcert-certified-associate-in-project-management-fifth-edition\">CAPM practice test.</a>\r\n<h3><strong>CompTIA Project+ Overview</strong></h3>\r\nProject+ validates the ability to initiate, manage and support a project or business initiative. Project+ is designed for any individual who wants to validate project management experience.\r\n<h4><strong>What are the Prerequisites? </strong></h4>\r\nCompTIA Project+ requires no prerequisites or application submission. Also, the need of continuous education upgrading is not required.\r\n\r\nInstead, they recommend one year of managing, directing or participating in small- to medium-scale projects prior to pursuing this certification.\r\n<h4><strong>Project+ Exam Details</strong></h4>\r\nThe certification exam, code PK0-003, has 100 multiple choice and drag/drop questions which testers have 90 minutes to complete. You must receive a score of 710 or higher out of 900 in order to pass.\r\n<h4><strong>What Does Earning the Project+ Mean? </strong></h4>\r\nObtaining your certification signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to initiate, manage and support a project or business initiative.\r\n<h4><strong>What Tools Does Cybrary Offer In Preparation for the Project+? </strong></h4>\r\nCybrary offers a <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/course/practical-project-management/\">‘Practical Project Management Course’</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/transcender_tests/compcert-project\">Project+ practice test.</a>\r\n<h3><strong>How Do CAPM and Project+ Compare? </strong></h3>\r\nAs you can see, the prerequisites for the CAPM exam may make this certification less attainable for many.\r\n\r\nWhile the CAPM may appear to be a better option since it is also developed by PMI, the Project+ was developed on the same PMBOK (project management body of knowledge), meaning it covers the same information as the CAPM, and both require passing only 1 test to become certified.\r\n\r\nIn a write up from ExamCollection.com, they say, “Compared to the CAPM, Project+ comes from a computing industry-spanning organization that develops its certification programs based on the needs and input from industry stakeholders, from leading IT companies to government organizations, education institutions etc. This way, CompTIA Project+ credential targets the needs of project management with a special focus on the IT industry – which adds a huge value to this certification.”\r\n\r\nAlthough some many consider the Project+ may seem less valuable to some, it is just as good of a stepping stone to PMP as the CAPM is. CAPM offers more of a challenge, but Project+ is more IT industry focused, which may be a defining factor for those looking to work as a technical PM.\r\n<h3><strong>PMP Overview</strong></h3>\r\nFor those who meet the previously mentioned requirements needed for PMP and are considering preparing for the certification exam, we will cover everything you need to get certified.\r\n\r\nAccording to PMI, “If you’re an experienced project manager responsible for all aspects of project delivery, leading and directing cross-functional teams, then the PMP is the right choice for you.”\r\n\r\nThroughout your PMP training, you will cover and subsequently be tested on:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Management and processes in context</li>\r\n \t<li>Integration management</li>\r\n \t<li>Scope management</li>\r\n \t<li>Time management</li>\r\n \t<li>Cost management</li>\r\n \t<li>Quality management</li>\r\n \t<li>Human Resource management</li>\r\n \t<li>Communication management</li>\r\n \t<li>Risk management</li>\r\n \t<li>Procurement management</li>\r\n \t<li>Stakeholder management</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4><strong>Additional PMP Information</strong></h4>\r\nPMP has over 500,000 active certified holders.\r\n<h4><strong>PMP Exam Details</strong></h4>\r\nThe certification exam has 200 multiple choice questions which testers have four hours to complete. It is known for being an especially difficult exam.\r\n<h4><strong>What Does Earning the PMP Mean? </strong></h4>\r\nObtaining your certification signifies that you possess the fundamental knowledge to initiate, plan and manage a project, control the process behind analyzing risk, monitor and control project contracts and develop schedules and budgets.\r\n\r\nIt also “signifies that you speak and understand the global language of project management and connects you to a community of professionals, organizations and experts worldwide.”\r\n<h4><strong>What Tools Does Cybrary Offer In Preparation for the Project+? </strong></h4>\r\nCybrary offers a <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/course/project-management-professional/\">‘Project Management Professional Course’ </a>as well as a <a href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/transcender_tests/pmcert-project-management-professional-fifth-edition-2016-revision\">PMP practice test.</a>\r\n<h3><strong>Do Cybrary Courses Count as PMI Approved ‘Project Management Education Contact Hours?’ </strong></h3>\r\nAccording to PMI, “Formal project management education means classes and training, online, virtual or face-to-face, that are run by a reputable vendor. That could be a community college, university, national training provider, a local firm or a training business operating entirely online. If you don't know whether your chosen provider is reputable, ask around or read some reviews. It's important because if you are audited you'll need their support in the form of a certificate of attendance or similar.”\r\n<h3><strong>To Summarize</strong></h3>\r\nNot only are project management certifications in high demand, but they come with a variety of options for those looking to get the experience and stand out in the talent pool.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Project+</strong> has no prerequisites and is geared towards IT professionals.\r\n\r\n<strong>The CAPM</strong> has strict prerequisites and is therefore considered to be more challenging.\r\n\r\n<strong>The PMP</strong> has strict prerequisites but is considered the gold standard of project management certifications.\r\n\r\n<strong>Want More Posts Comparing Certifications?</strong>\r\n\r\nLeave a comment describing what you’d like to learn more about.\r\n<div class=\"postArticle-content js-postField js-notesSource js-trackedPost\" data-post-id=\"6c363e797fff\" data-source=\"post_page\" data-collection-id=\"33024b0003d8\" data-tracking-context=\"postPage\" data-scroll=\"native\"><section class=\"section section--body section--first section--last\">\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<figure id=\"97fb\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\" data-scroll=\"native\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*TJdKYCTCfie03veg.png\" data-width=\"235\" data-height=\"300\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image alignleft\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*TJdKYCTCfie03veg.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"230\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*TJdKYCTCfie03veg.png\" /><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/members/olynch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https://www.cybrary.it/members/olynch/\">Olivia Lynch</a> </strong><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">(@Cybrary_Olivia) </strong>is the Marketing Manager at Cybrary.

The SYN-packet ties up a small amount of memory on the target's computer or network device.\r\n\r\nThis is also known as a half open connection where the connection is not fully established since its still waiting for the fill handshake to occur.\r\n\r\nThese half open connections  can eventually exhaust the resources on the device. This will eventually leading to a crash.\r\n<h5></h5>\r\n<h5>Mitigation</h5>\r\nTo  mitigate this type of attack you can rate limit SYN-traffic per source  also you can use mechanisms such as MOD Evasive  fro Apache servers to protect  web servers.\r\n\r\nFor your Anti DDoS solution you may need to tweak settings if you are using NAT as its not unusual to see many SYN-packets  going to the single NAT address.\r\n\r\n<strong>See the below video:</strong>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZMl05ymqWI?rel=0\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\r\nFollow or email me: www.seanmancini.com - sean@seanmancini.com",

A side by side comparison of Obama's and Trump's policy and it’s clear. Trump simply mandated compliance of Obama’s 2013 executive order within 90 days. While his tactic of “do what the other guy did” is nothing innovative for American policy, it does validate the precedent set by his presidential predecessor.\r\n\r\nOn May 11th Donald Trump signed an executive order carrying forward his predecessor’s policy and mandated that all federal agencies have 90 days to adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, among other requirements. For executives required to adopt the framework, there are a few things you should know. Mainly, how it provides a mechanism for organizations to:\r\n\r\n<em>1) Describe their current cybersecurity posture</em>\r\n\r\n<em>2) Describe their target state for cybersecurity</em>\r\n\r\n<em>3) Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process</em>\r\n\r\n<em>4) Assess progress toward the target state</em>\r\n\r\n<em>5) Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk</em>\r\n<h3><strong>OBAMA’S CYBERSECURITY LEGACY</strong></h3>\r\nNo executive administration in America’s history had to confront cybersecurity as a national priority the way Obama did. The myriad of prolific Obama era cyber-attacks were more frequent, farther reaching and sophisticated.\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration came up with a plan to address the defense of America's digital infrastructure. It was the first of its kind drafted by a president who recognized the need to secure America’s newly developed cyber frontier. The directive came equipped with the largest multibillion-dollar investment in American cyber security. Intended to establish a cybersecurity framework, the original policy tasked the:\r\n<blockquote><em>“National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to lead the development of a framework to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure.”</em></blockquote>\r\nThe unprecedented legislation also gave rise to a new breed of partnerships between the public and private sector. A partnership rooted not in silos but sharing of information regarding cyber security risks. The result paved way for the first, NIST sponsored, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) known as the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). Affectionately known by the industry as “the center”, the NCCoE served as the nexus of collaboration for America’s tech giants, government agencies, and academia to mitigate cybersecurity risks in as they applied to specific economic sectors.\r\n\r\nWith an overnight budget of $5 billion, The Center cemented itself as a new breed of cyber unicorn, solidifying Obama's vision for securing the nation's critical infrastructure.\r\n<h3>THE NEED FOR CYBER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT</h3>\r\nIn January, President Donald Trump committed to developing a national cybersecurity strategy in 80 days. With a large focus on workforce development. The order mandates:\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\"</em></strong><em>Agency heads shall show preference in their procurement for shared IT services, to the extent permitted by law, including email, cloud, and cyber security services.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Further, the United States seeks to support the growth and sustainment of a workforce that is skilled in cyber security and related fields as the foundation for achieving our objectives in cyberspace.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Workforce Development. In order to ensure that the United States maintains a long-term cyber security advantage:</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(A) jointly assess the scope and sufficiency of efforts to educate and train the American cyber security workforce of the future, including cybersecurity-related education curricula, training, and apprenticeship programs, from primary through higher education; and</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(B) within 120 days of the date of this order, provide a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, with findings and recommendations regarding how to support the growth and sustainment of the Nation's cybersecurity workforce in both the public and private sectors.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>(C) review the workforce development efforts of potential foreign cyber peers in order to help identify foreign workforce development practices likely to affect long-term United States cyber security competitiveness\"</em>\r\n\r\nThis long-delayed policy is an effort to secure porous federal networks, create framework focused security activities, and develop a cyber-savvy workforce.\r\n<h3>THE CYBER WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE</h3>\r\n<em>So how does one prepare a cyber-workforce for the future?</em>\r\n\r\nImagine an online platform that provides a combination of training, assessment, and communication. A solution that integrates security assessments into your workforce. A security tool designed to enhance the learning experience. A platform where information sharing actually increases security. A tool that empowers the American workforce.
